# Concept Questions

##

Suppose that a prisoner is about to be executed by a firing squad. A certain chain of events must occur for this to happen. First, the judge orders the execution. The order goes to a captain, who signals the two soldiers of the firing squad (soldier 1 and soldier 2) to fire. They are obedient and expert marksmen, so they only fire on command, and if either one of them shoots, the prisoner dies.

::: poll
Using the conditional counterfactual definition, who caused the death of the prisoner?

A. The judge  
B. The captain  
C. Soldier 1  
D. Soldier 2
:::

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1)
```

:::notes
The goal of this example is to reinforce the definition of cause and effect by applying it to a fairly complicated causal graph. The correct answers are A and B, because had the judge not ordered, or had the captain not signaled, the prisoner would not have died. Each of the soldiers individually fail this definition because if one of them doesn't fire (and they're acting independently), the prisoner will still die.

You can debrief this one by drawing a causal diagram with judge -> captain -> -> two arrows to separate solider 1 and soldier 2 -> -> two arrows back to prisoner. You can start at the top, drawing 2 by 3 data frames of first the judge, then captain, then soldiers, showing one world in the first row and the other world in the second row and showing that the potential outcomes would differ based on the action of the first two.

You can also use the graph method of: if you break the causal chain after a given node, is there still a connected path to the prisoner? The answer is no for judge and captain but yes for each solider.

Students may bring up good points about ambiguity in the wording of the problem or a different interpretation of the "rules of the game" around how the causal structure works. That's good! If students suggest different interpretations, you could draw that graph or draw that data frame, and analyze that one to identify causes.

As a postscript, this is likely one reason why firing squads are have multiple shooters. Each one has plausible deniability that "the prisoner would have died anyways", so they didn't cause the death. Apparently, it's common for marksmen to occasionally neglect to fire, so this also has redundancy. The judge and captain, though they might be insolated from guilt because they are higher up the causal chain, they are still a cause of the death by this definition.

# PS 8 / PS 9: A Matter of Taste

**Constructing Claims from Data**

:::notes
Suggested timeline
- [10 min] Slides and making teams
- [40 min] Working on the protocol

General Advice
- The students have seen *nothing* about experimental design yet in class. The idea is to have them use their own mental models to solve this problem, then later review and revise them. That's to say: coach them only to be precise in their protocol, not to be using best practices in experimental design. Errors made here are great learning opportunities later.
- The first phase of the lab can all be done with paper and pencil, so you can ask that students stow their laptops.
- This can be a bit of a jolt for students: from working with ggplot2 code to suddenly thinking about experiments without having seen them in class.

##

- **John Arbuthnot's Question**: What proportion of total births are of girls?

. . .

- **The Data**: Christening records from London churches.

. . .

- **The Analysis**: In all years studied, the proportion of girls was less than 50%.

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-height: 3
#| message: false
#| fig-align: center

library(tidyverse)
library(stat20data)
data(arbuthnot)
arbuthnot <- arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(p_girls = girls / (boys + girls))
ggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = p_girls)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  theme_gray(base_size = 14)
```

- **Potential Claim**: At birth, humans are more likely to be genetically male than genetically female.

:::notes
First layout the arc of the Arbuthnot lab from the beginning of the semester. The general theme is: how can we construct claims and answer questions using data?

This week students will work backwards: start with a claim that they think may be true, then decide how to collect data in a manner that will be most effective at determining whether or not the claim is true.
:::

## But first

Please get into groups of 3 (4 is ok too). Take turns introducing yourselves.


## A Matter of Taste

**Your challenge**: Determine whether or not one of your group members can distinguish between two different types of bubble water (or a similar claim of your choosing).

### Each team will have

- 50 minutes (lab Thursday)
- 2 cans of soda water, each one from a different flavor
- small cups
- straws
- saltine crackers

## Group Members

![](images/members.png)

:::notes
The main reason for the roles here is to dedicate just one person to handling the materials for covid safety. There will also be sanitizer.
:::

## Claim and Hypotheses

![](images/claim.png)

:::notes
Prompt them to think carefully about their wording here in the claim. How ambitious and general do they want to be?
:::


## Protocol

![](images/protocol.png)

:::notes
Here they must be very precise. We're spoken about reproducible science in class, so use that language to encourage careful work. They must be able to pass this protocol off to another group, and they should be able to carry out the intended experiment with no ambiguity.
:::


## Data


![](images/data.png)

:::notes
This is intended to be a blank table with n rows and at least 1 column. They may plan to record either several extraneous variables or not enough to draw the conclusions they intend. As before, don't correct them. They may discover mid-experiment that they did this part wrong, and that's great.

## Things to remember

- Be precise in your protocol.
- Be sure your claim corresponds to your protocol corresponds to your data corresponds to your plots.
- Before leaving today, scan both sides of the handout with a scanner app and upload to Gradescope as PS 8.
