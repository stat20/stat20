# A Matter of Taste II

Please:

1. Conduct your experiment
2. Record your data
3. Complete and submit PS 9 as a group (see notes page for today for link).

If you don't finish in the allotted time, finish up PS 9 after class.

# Principles of Experimental Design

## The Essential Question of Our Time

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/la-croix.png")
```

::: poll
Which is the best flavor?
:::

:::notes
This purely for fun. Some people have strong opinions about this.
:::

##

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/la-croix.png")
```

::: poll
Could your taster distinguish between flavors?

A. Yes, and it was statistically significant (p < .05)
B. Yes, but it was not statistically significant (p > .05)
B. No.
C. We tested a different claim
:::

:::
The goal of this question is to allow all groups to, in brief, share their results with the class. It also opens up the conversation about how there were many different ways to carry out this experiment. Two groups might have come to different conclusions because their tasters really had different abilities, or because their claims and experiments were slightly different, or just due to random chance.
