## Agenda

-  Concept Questions
-  Communication Critique
-  Practice Problems

# Concept Questions

## TikTok algorithm

::: poll
The TikTok recommendation algorithm is an example of which principle of communication?
:::

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1)
```

:::notes
Adapt to your audience! The algorithm learns what you like and shows you more.
:::

## Which formatting is the most readable?

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1)
```

::: notes
There is no right or wrong answer here. Personally I find snake case to be the most readable.

In programming we often avoid the `-` and `.` in variable names because they take special names in certain languages. In R these are ok to use in variable names.
:::


## Not an example of hierarchy

::: poll
Which of the following is NOT an example of hierarchical organization.
:::

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1)
```

::: notes
A: words in a sentence

These must be read sequentially to make sense.
:::



# Communication Critique

- Are there ways to improve how the content was communicated?

::: notes
Pick your favorite website, app, data visualization, etc.
