# Question 1: stat20 website

Critique our course website, [www.stat20.org/](https://www.stat20.org/) (either the whole website or a specific part e.g. one set of notes/slides, etc).

# Question 2: a data visualization

Any data visualization. Could be something in our course or anywhere else. Some suggestions\
\

-   Check out [Flowing data](https://flowingdata.com/made-by-flowingdata/), for example

    -   [Where bars out number grocery stores](https://flowingdata.com/2014/05/29/bars-versus-grocery-stores-around-the-world/)

    -   [Commonnness of Divorce in America](https://flowingdata.com/2022/06/07/commonness-of-divorce-in-america/)

    -   [Life satisfaction and age](https://flowingdata.com/2022/11/10/life-satisfaction-and-age/)

    -   [Rhythm of food](https://rhythm-of-food.net/)

# Question 3: something else

Choose a piece of public communication. This could be anything e.g. a news article, a website, a visualization, etc. Post a link to the piece so we can see what you are talking about. For example, you could pick [AirBnB's pitch deck to venture capitalists](https://www.slideshare.net/PitchDeckCoach/airbnb-first-pitch-deck-editable).
