## Sally Clark: a tragic victim of statistical illiteracy

[I]{.dropcap}n November 1999, Sally Clark, an English solicitor, was convicted of murdering her infant sons[^1]. The first, Christopher, had been 11 weeks old when he died, in 1996, and the second, Harry, 8 weeks old, in January 1998, when he was found dead. Christopher was believed to have been a victim of "cot death", called SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) in the US. After her second baby, Harry, also died in his crib, Sally Clark was arrested for murder. The star witness for the prosecution was a well known pediatrician and professor, Sir Roy Meadow, who authored the infamous Meadow's Law :"One sudden infant death is a tragedy, two is suspicious and three is murder until proved otherwise"[^2]. Unfortunately it was easier to comprehend this "crude aphorism" than make the effort to understand the subtleties of conditional probability. The Royal Statistical Society protested the misuse of statistics in courts, but not early enough to prevent Sally Clark's conviction. She was eventually acquitted and released, only to die at the age of 42 through alcohol poisoning[^3] The math presented by Meadow, in brief: Based on various studies, there is a chance of 1 in 8,543 of a baby dying of SIDS in a family such as the Clarks. As the Clarks suffered *two* deaths, Meadow multiplied 8,543 by 8,543 to arrive at 73 million. He told the jury that the chance that the event of two "cot deaths" was 1 in 73 million. The defense did not employ a statistician to refute her claim, a choice that may have been disastrous for Sally Clark.

We will revisit this case at the end of these notes. Now, let's talk about the *conditional chance* of an event.

## Computing chances

So far, in this unit, we have spoken of target populations and access frames for sampling. For these notes, we are going to assume that our box contains the entire population: that is, our access frame and our population coincide.

#### Example 1: Drawing red and blue tickets from a box

Consider a box with four tickets in it, two colored red and two blue. Except for their color, they are identical: ![](images/box-red-blue.jpeg){width="100"}. Suppose we draw three times at random from this box, with replacement. List all the possible outcomes. What is the chance of seeing exactly 2 red cards among our draws?

<details>

<summary>Check your answer</summary>

Note that since each of the cards is equally likely to be drawn, therefore all the sequences of three cards are equally likely. We can count the number of possible outcomes that contain exactly 2 red cards, and divide that number by the number of total possible outcomes to get the chance of drawing exactly 2 red cards:

![](images/rb-box-3-draws.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="600"} There are three outcomes that have exactly two cards, out of a total of 8 possible outcomes, so the chance of exactly two red cards in three draws at random with replacement is 3/8.

</details>

Now suppose we repeat the procedure, but draw *without* replacement. What is the chance of exactly 2 red cards in 3 draws?

<details>

<summary>Check your answer</summary>

![](images/rb-box-3-draws-no-repl.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="550"}

Notice that we have fewer possible outcomes (6 instead of 8, why?), though they are still equally likely. Again, there are 3 outcomes that have exactly 2 red cards, and so the chance of 2 red cards in three draws is now 3/6.

</details>

What about the probability distribution table for the number of red cards in three draws? Write down the probability distribution table for the number of red cards in three draws from a box with 2 red cards and 2 blue cards, while drawing *with* replacement, and then write down the probability distribution table for the same quantity (number of red cards in three draws from a box with 2 red cards and 2 blue cards), when you draw the tickets  *without* replacement:

<details> <summary>Check your answer</summary>

<center>

<!-- <div style="width:300px"> -->

| Number of reds in 3 draws |  Chance, with replacement   | Chance, without replacement |
|:---------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
|       0 red tickets       | $\displaystyle \frac{1}{8}$ |             $0$              |
|       1 red ticket        | $\displaystyle \frac{3}{8}$ | $\displaystyle \frac{3}{6}$ |
|       2 red tickets       | $\displaystyle \frac{3}{8}$ | $\displaystyle \frac{3}{6}$ |
|       3 red tickets       | $\displaystyle \frac{1}{8}$ |             $0$              |

<!-- </div> -->

</center>

Why are the numbers different? What is going on?

</details>

Below you see an illustration of what happens to the box when we draw *without* replacement.

![](images/without-repl-1.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="600"}

We see that the box (our access frame) reduces after each draw. After two draws, if the first 2 draws are red (as on the left most sequence) you can't get another red ticket, whereas if you are drawing *with* replacement, you can keep on drawing red tickets.

### Rules of chance (recap)

Recall the rules of chance and the terms we have seen so far. Suppose we have some action such as tossing a coin, drawing from a box etc. for which we know all the *possible* results from this action, but we don't know *which* particular one will occur on any instance of the action. All the possible things that can happen are called outcomes, and the collection of all the outcomes is called the *sample space* or *outcome space*. We can call it $S$. If $A$ is a subset of $S$, we call $A$ an *event*. What can we say about $A$ and $S$?

1. $S$ is the set of all possible outcomes. <details> <summary> What is the chance of $S$? </summary> 
The chance of $S$ is 1. It is called the *certain* event. 
</details>

2. When an event has **no** outcomes in it, it is called the *impossible* event, and denoted by 
$\emptyset$. <details> <summary> What is the chance of the impossible event?</summary> 
The chance of $\emptyset$ is 0.
</details>

3. Let $A$ be a collection of outcomes (for example, from the example above, $A$ could be the event of two red tickets in 3 draws with replacement). 
<details> <summary>Then the chance of $A$ has to be ______ (fill in the blank with a suitable phrase) </summary> 
 between 0 and 1.
 </details>
 
4. If $A$ and $B$ are two events with no outcomes in common, <details> <summary> then they are called ______ (fill in the blank with a suitable phrase) .</summary> 
 mutually exclusive.
  </details>
  
5. Consider an event $A$. The chance of an outcome *not* being in $A$ is 1 minus the chance of $A$, since the total chance is $1$. 
  
#### Example 2: Drawing tickets from a box to represent the number of heads in 3 tosses

If we are setting up a box for modeling the number of heads in three tosses of a fair coin, would either of the boxes below work? If not, say why not, and correct the box.

(a) ![](images/coin.jpeg){width="100"} - Draw three times at random with replacement, and sum the draws.
(b) ![](images/coin-wrong.jpeg){width="150"}-  Draw once, the result is the number of heads.

<details> <summary> Check your answer </summary> 
The first box is correct and represents a box model for this situation. The second box doesn't work because the tickets do not represent equally likely events. If you toss a fair coin 3 times and count the number of heads, the probability distribution of the number of heads is the same as when you draw a ticket three times at random with replacement from a box with 2 red tickets and 2 blue, and count the number of red tickets (the probability distribution above, in Example 1). If we wanted to use this example, we would have to create a different box that reflects the probability distribution of the number of heads in 3 tosses with equally likely tickets:

![](images/coin-3-tosses.jpeg){width="300"}
  
### Conditional probabilities 

In Example 1 above, we saw that the probability of a red ticket on a draw changes if we sample without replacement. If we get a blue ticket on the first draw, the chance of a red ticket on the second draw is 2/3 (since there are 3 tickets left, of which 2 are blue). 
If we get a red ticket on the first draw, the chance of a red ticket on the second draw is 1/3. These chances - that *depend* on what happened on the first draw are called *conditional chances*. If $A$ is the event of a blue ticket on the first draw, and $B$ is the event of a red ticket on the second draw, we say that the chance of $B$ *given* $A$ is 2/3, which is a *conditional* chance, because we put a condition on the first card, that it had to be blue. 

What about if we don't put a condition on the first card? What is the chance that the second card is red? 
<details> <summary> Check your answer </summary> 
The chance that the second card drawn is red is 1/2, if we don't have any information about the first card drawn. To see this, it is easier to imagine that we can shuffle all the cards in the box and they are put in some random order in which each of the 4 positions is equally likely. There are 2 red cards, so the chance that a red card will occupy any position, including the second, is 2/4.
</details>

This kind of chance, where we put no condition on the first card, is called an *unconditional* chance.

## The Multiplication Rule

Many of you would have seen the following rule to compute the chance of two events will *both* happen. This chance is the chance that the first will happen, multiplied by the chance that the second will happen, *given* that the first has happened.


## Independence

We say that two events are *independent* if the chances for the second remain the same even if you know that the first has happened, no matter how the first event turns out. Otherwise, the events are *dependent*.

For example, consider our box of red and blue tickets. When we draw *with* replacement, the chance of a red ticket on the second draw given a blue ticket on the first draw remains at 1/2. If we had a red ticket on the first draw, the chance of the second ticket being red is *still* 1/2. The chance doesn't change because it does not *depend* on the outcome of the first draw, since we put the ticket back. 

If we draw the tickets *without* replacement, we have seen that the chance changes. The chance of a red ticket on the second draw given a blue ticket on the first draw is 2/3, but the chance of a red ticket on the second draw given a red ticket on the first is 1/3. 

The lesson here is that when we draw tickets *with* replacement, the draws are **independent** - the outcome of the first draw does not affect the second. If we draw tickets *without* replacement, the draws are **dependent**. The outcome of the first draw changes the chances of the tickets for the second draw.

#### Example 3: Selecting 2 people out of a group of 5 
##### (drawing *without* replacement)
We have a group of 5 people: Alex, Emi, Fred, Max, and Nan. Two of the five are to be selected at random to form a two person committee. Draw the box model for this situation.

<details><summary>Check your answer</summary>

![](images/committee.jpeg){fig-align=center width="600"}

All the ten pairs are equally likely. On the first draw, there are 5 tickets to choose from, and on the second there are 4, making $5 \times 4 = 20$ possible draws of two tickets, drawn from this box, one at a time, without replacement. We have only 10 pairs here because of those 20 pairs, there are only 10 distinct ones. When we count 20 pairs, we are counting Alex $+$ Emi as one pair, and Emi $+$ Alex as another pair.  
</details> 

What is the chance that Alex and Emi will be selected? Guess! (Hint: you have seen all the possible pairs above, and they are equally likely. What will be the chance of any one of them?) 

We could use the multiplication rule to compute this chance, which is *much* simpler than writing out all the possible outcomes. The committee can consist of Alex and Emi either if Alex is drawn first **and** Emi second, **or** Emi is drawn first **and** Alex second. The chance that Alex will be drawn first is $1/5$. The conditional chance that Emi will be drawn second *given* that Alex was drawn is $1/4$ since there are only 4 tickets left in the box. Using the multiplication rule, the chance that Alex will be drawn first and Emi second is $(1/4) \times (1/5) = 1/20$. Similarly, the chance that Emi will be drawn first and Alex second is $1/20$. This means that the chance that Alex and Emi will be selected for the committee is $1/20 + 1/20 = 1/10$.


#### Example 4: Colored and numbered tickets

I have two boxes that with numbered tickets colored red or blue as shown below. 

![](images/indep-box.jpeg){fig-align=center width=300}


Are color and number independent or dependent for box 1? What about box 2? 

For example, is the chance of a ticket marked 2 the same whether the ticket is red or blue?

<details><summary>Check your answer</summary>

For box 1, color and number are dependent, since the chance of 3 given that the ticket is red is 1/3, but the chance of 3 given that the ticket is blue is 0 (and similarly for the chance of 4).

Even though the chance for 1 or 2 given the ticket is red is the same as the chance for 1 or 2 given the ticket is blue, we say that color and number are *dependent* because of the tickets marked 3 or 4.

</details>

#### Example 5: Tickets with more than one number on them

Now I have two boxes that with numbered tickets, where each ticket has two numbers on them, as shown. For each box, are the two numbers independent or dependent. For example, if I know that the first number is 1 does it change the chance of the second number being 6 (or the other way around: if I know the second number is 6, does it change the chance of the first number being 1)?

![](images/box-2-number.jpeg){fig-align=center width=400}
<details><summary>Check your answer</summary>

For box 1, the first number and second number are independent, as shown below, using 1 and 6 as examples. If we know that the first number is 1, the box reduces as shown. The chance of the second number being 6 does not change for box 1. The chance *does* change for box 2, increasing from 1/2 to 2/3, since the second number is more likely to be 6 if the first number is 1.

![](images/box-2-number-cond.jpeg){fig-align=center width=750}
</details>

#### Example 6: Back to Sally Clark

Professor Roy Meadow claimed that the chance of two of Sally Clark's sons dying of SIDS was 1 in 73 million. He obtained this number by multiplying 8543 by 8543, using the multiplication rule, treating the two events as *independent*. The question is, are they really independent? Was a crime really committed? Unfortunately for Sally Clark, two catastrophic errors were committed in her case by the prosecution, and not caught by the defense. (She appealed the decision, and was acquitted and released, but after spending 4 years in prison, accused of murdering her babies.)

The first error was in treating the deaths as independent, and the second was in looking at the wrong probability. Let's look at the first mistake. It turns out that the chance of a second child dying of "cot death" or SIDS is 1/60 *given* that the first child died of SIDS. This was a massive error, and it turned out that the prosecution suppressed the pathology reports for the second baby, who had a very bad infection and might have died of that. It is also believed that male infants are more likely to suffer cot death. 

The second error is an example of what is called the Prosecutor's Fallacy. They looked the chance of the evidence if Sally Clark were innocent. They should have actually compared the chance of innocence given the evidence with the chance of murder given the evidence. These multiple errors ruined many lives. Though Sally Clark was eventually acquitted, helped by the Royal Statistical Society's evidence, her life was shattered, and she died soon after being released. The moral of this story is to be very careful while multiplying probabilities. You must check for independence. 

## Summary

In this lecture, we do a deep dive into computing chances. It is well known that people are just not good at estimating chances of events, and we saw the tragic example of Sally Clark (who, even more sadly, is not a unique case)[^js]. 

We defined conditional probability and independence, and the multiplication rule, considering draws at random with and without replacement. 

In the next lecture, we will learn about sampling, and estimating *population parameters*.
