# Concept Questions

## 

You embark on a mission to estimate a population mean used a simple random sample of $n$ observations.

:::poll
What sample size would you need to increase the precision of your estimate by 3x compared to the original sample?
:::

:::notes
A. n + 3
B. 3n
D. n + 6
C. 6n
D. 9n

This assesses the 1/sqrt(n) relationship between the SE and the SD. It appeared in the Reading Questions in a slightly different form, but is likely worth talking through together.

##

An economist aims to estimate the average weekly cost of groceries per household in two cites: Grimes, CA (population ~400) and Tranquility, CA (population ~800). Both of these populations of households are presumed to have a similar standard deviation of weekly grocery costs. The demographer takes a simple random sample (without replacement) of 100 households from each city, records their costs, and computes a 95% confidence interval for the average weekly cost.

:::poll
Approximately how much wider would Tranquility's confidence interval be than Grimes's?
:::

:::notes
A. Half as wide
B. Roughly 10% less than Grimes
C. The same width
D. Roughly 10% more than Grimes
E. Twice as wide

Sampling without replacement in a setting where n is not significantly smaller than N will end up showing less variability in statistics than when N is huge. The effect is slight, so you can eyeball that the answer should be D.

You can get the precise answer by calculating the finitee population correction factor for each one: \sqrt((N - n)/(N-1))

An economist aims to estimate the average weekly cost of groceries per household in two cites: Oakland, CA (population ~400,000) and Fremont, CA (population ~200,000). Both of these populations of households are presumed to have a similar standard deviation of weekly grocery costs. The economist takes a simple random sample (without replacement) of 100 households from each city, records their costs, and computes a 95% confidence interval for the average weekly cost.

:::poll
Approximately how much wider would Oakland's confidence interval be than Fremont's?
:::

:::notes
A. 1.5 times as wide
B. 2 times as wide
C. 3 times as wide
D. 4 times as wide
E. The same width

It's more or less E here since N is so large.

What will happen to the shape of the **empirical distribution** as we increase $n$?

:::notes
A. The standard deviation will decrease.
B. The standard deviation will increase.
C. The mean will increase
D. It will more closely resemble the population dist.
E. It will more closely resemble the sampling dist.

The answer is D.

# Practice Problems

## Sampling Vectors

. . .

`sample()`: used to take a random sample of a vector with or without replacement. 

\

#### Example

How can you use `sample()` to create the following vector from `a`: 1.75, 1.75, 1.25?

```{r}
#| echo: true
a <- seq(from = 1, to = 2, by = .25)
sample(a, size = 3, replace = TRUE)
```

## Sampling Data Frames

`slice_sample()`: takes a random sample of the rows of a data frame.

\

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)

penguins %>%
  slice_sample(n = 4)
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)

penguins %>%
  slice_sample(n = 4)
```
