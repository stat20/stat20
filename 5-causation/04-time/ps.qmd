<!-- ## Case Study 2: Cherry Blossom Run	 -->

<!-- The Cherry Blossom Run is an annual 10-mile race that takes place in April in Washington D.C. when the cherry trees are in bloom. Data were scraped from the Runâ€™s Web pages and include official times and other information, such as the age, sex, and address for all registered runners from 1999 to 2012. Originally designed as a preparatory race for professional runners in the New York Marathon, the Cherry Blossom Run has gained popularity and now over 10,000 people participate each year. An ambitious data scientist used these data to compare the times of 30-year-old runners to 50-year-old runners, to study how run times decreased as people age. 	 -->

<!-- 1. Describe the sample. How large is it ($n$) and what is the unit of observation? -->

<!-- \ -->

<!-- 2. Describe the population. How large is it ($N$)? -->

<!-- \ -->

<!-- 3. Identify the population parameter that researchers are interested in estimating and the corresponding statistic that will serve as the estimate. -->

<!-- \ -->

<!-- 4. Identify possible sources of bias and whether they are selection or measurement bias. How do you expect this will effect the estimate of the parameter? -->

<!-- 6. On a separate sheet of paper, make two sketches: an empirical distribution of the data and what you think the sampling distribution of the statistic might look like given what you know about the data collection. Be sure to label the axes of both plots. Add a vertical line on the sampling distribution that hits the x-axis where you expect the population parameter to be. -->

## Case Study: Minimum Wage and the NJ/PA fast food industry, con't.

We continue our analysis of minimum wage and employment using Card and Krueger's
data about the 1992 New Jersey minimum wage increase.  We now use a different
version of the data that contains covariate and outcome values for each store
both before and after New Jersey's policy change.  This dataframe can be loaded
as `fastfood2` from the `stat20data` package.


@. Describe in words how to construct a pre/post estimate for this dataset, and
how to construct a difference in difference estimate.  What are the differences
in the assumptions we rely on between these two designs?  Which do you think is
more plausible?

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\


@. What additional data would we need to have available to conduct an
interrupted time series design?  How would the associated assumptions differ from
those in a pre/post design?

\
\
\
\
\
\

@. Sketch a line plot showing how you anticipate employment levels will change 
between the two timepoints, with one line  averaging over all New Jersey 
restaurants and one line averaging over all Pennsylvania restaurants.
 
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\


@. Write code to create a line plot like the one in the previous question and
construct it.  Describe similarities and differences between the hypothesized
and actual plots.

\
\
\
\
\
\
\



@. Write code to compute the pre/post estimate and difference in difference
estimators.  Run the code and compare the values obtained to each other and to
the effects you obtained from the `fastfood1` dataset in the previous problem set.


\
\
\
\
\
\
\


@. Write code to construct a bootstrap confidence interval or a hypothesis test
for one of the estimates in the previous question, making sure to permute or 
bootstrap restaurants rather than individual observations.

@. Recently  a new minimum wage of \$20 per hour went into effect in California.
Raising the wage to this level was a politically
controversial decision.  Give an example of both predictive and causal claims 
that proponents or detractors of the law might make and describe how they are different.  

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\



@. To what extent is your analysis of Card and
Krueger's fast food data relevant for evaluating the claims from the previous question?  To the 
degree it is relevant, what does it tell us about the claims?
