The context may depends upon:\n\n- Audience (business executives, data scientists, etc)\n- Medium (slide show, text document, etc)\n- Purpose (convey results, impress an employer, etc)\n- Content (we built a predictive model, drug A doesn't work, etc)\n- Time (do you have a day or a week to prepare?)\n\n\nIn data science we communicate through a variety of mediums:\n\n- Code\n- Written document\n- Static visualizations\n- Dynamic visualizations\n- Interactive application[^shiny]\n- Slideshow\n- Web page\n- Speaking\n- Literate programming (e.g. Quarto document)\n\n[^shiny]: [https://shiny.rstudio.com/](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)\n\n## Four priniciples for effective communication\n\n\n1. Adapt to your audience\n2. Maximize the signal-to-noise ratio\n3. Use effective redundancy\n4. There are usually trade-offs\n\nThe first three of these principles come from *Trees, Maps and Theorems*[^tmt] and are inspired by information theory.[^info] \n\n[^info]: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory)\n\n\n\n\n### 1. Adapt to your audience\n\nAdapting to the audience means you take responsibility for the success or failure of your message reaching the audience.\nIt comes naturally to us; you talk to your parents differently from how you talk to your best friend.\nThe act of adapting requires empathy; you have to understand how the recipient perceives the information you are conveying.\nAdapting also requires some persistence; if the first strategy does not succeed then try another one.\n\n\nAdapting is partially an act of generosity.\nHow many hours of your life have been wasted sitting through a lecture that you didn't get much out of?\nCommunicating well is also self-serving; it will make your work more impact and advance your career faster.[^businesses] \n\n[^businesses]: Businesses are not customer-minded (e.g. \"the customer is always right\") out of the goodness of their hearts; adapting to their audience will earn them more money.\n\nUnderstanding who is in the audience is a critical step. Some common types of audience members you may face include:\n\n- Familiar or unfamiliar with the topic\n- Technical or non-technical\n- Expert in the topic at hand or in a similar but distinct topic\n- Native or non-native language speakers\n- Interested or uninterested in the topic\n\nMany audiences are heterogeneous, which presents an extra challenge.\n\nIt's helpful to keep in mind  limitations of your audience.\nYou are probably much more familiar with the background/context of your work than your audience is.\nMany people in your audience will only skim or pay half attention to what you are saying. Structuring your communication with these constraints in mind will go a long way.\n\n### 2. Maximize the signal-to-noise ratio\n\n\n<!-- We want to focus on communicating the important/interesting  -->\n\nFocus on the important parts of what you're saying (the signal) and minimize the unimportant details (the noise).\n\n> Nothing is neutral in communication.[^tmt]\n\nThe audience sees every dot in a graphic and hears every word you speak. Anything that does not convey your message to the audience can hamper your message. Often message optimization is more about minimizing noise than maximizing signal. \n\nFor visualization, simple and focused is often better than fancy and detailed.\nFor example watch the progression of a poor graphic to an effective graphic in  [this blog post](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2017/3/29/declutter-this-graph).\n\nIt's helpful to make documents/presentations/webpages consistent and minimal. For example, make all formatting (font, text size, structure, webpage style, graph colors, etc) uniform throughout.\nChanges in formatting will draw the audience's attention so use it selectively.\nSimilarly, bolding and emphasis words (very, really, etc) should be also be used selectively. \n<!-- [this article](http://www.dataschool.io/reproducibility-is-not-just-for-researchers/) -->\n\n<!-- Optimizing a message's delivery first requires a clear understanding of exactly what the message is. -->\n<!-- Figuring out your thesis is not always easy; it sometimes takes several rounds of revision to home in on and understand your thesis. -->\n\n\n### 3. Use effective redundancy\n\nIf you convey your message in multiple ways the audience has more than one chance to understand the message.\nFor example, stop sign conveys its message in three ways: color, text and shape. \n\n<!-- ![http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mitch-ditkoff/the-curious-origins-of-th_b_9720358.html](http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-04-18-1460992862-2887201-iStock_000022162723_Small.jpg) -->\n\n![](images/stop_sign.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" fig-width=\"250\"}\n\n\\\n\nRedundancy can also mean repetition.\nFor example, for oral presentations:\n\n> Tell them what you are going to tell them. Tell them. Then tell them what you told them.\n\nStating the main points both at the beginning and end will reinforce your message to the audience.\n\n\n### 4. Trade-offs\nYou may have come across the famous quote in an Economics class:\n\n> There ain't no such thing as a free lunch. \n\n\nThere are usually trade-offs to decisions.\n\n\nIn the context of communication the biggest \"cost\" can be time spent preparing; it takes time to communicate well.\nTweaking a single graphic can take hours.\nYour goal is not perfection; your goal is \"good enough\" for the purpose at hand. \n\n\"Good enough\" is context dependent. An email to your parents might get a quick glace over while an email to a potential employer likely takes multiple rounds of revision. \n\nOther trade-offs might include:\n\n- Provide more detail vs. make the content easier to understand\n- Targeting one audience vs. another audience\n\n\n## Communication strategies\n\nThis section discusses a number of strategies for effective communication.\n\n### Revise, revise, revise\n\nDo many rounds of revision. This applies to coding, writing, oral presentations and making visualizations. Revision is one of the best ways to improve something. Stepping away then coming back will give your a fresh perspective. It will also help you catch errors.\n\nYou should constructively attack any work you are editing (both your own or someone else’s). \n\n> When editing go for the jugular.[^calum]\n\n[^calum]: Professor Calum Carmichael\n\nWhen giving someone else feedback on their work it is important to be constructive, respectful, and empathetic. \n\nIf you are publishing something publicly you should want revise it several times. If it's something that really matters then you ideally want to outside feedback from several people.\n\n\n<!-- Revision is also about iteration.  -->\n<!-- For example, one of the principles of Agile software development is:  -->\n<!-- > Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast. -->\n<!-- Complex engineering (and communication!) problems are typically solved iteratively.  -->\n\n\n\n### State the message first and explicitly, *then* state the details\n\nIt's usually a good idea to state the message *before* the details of the argument in a presentation/written document. The message is often more important than the details, and the structure of the document tends to reflect this imbalance. The audience may not appreciate the message without motivation so providing context should come before the message. \n\nMany professional communications are structured as:\n\n1. Motivation (what is the problem and why should the audience care?)\n2. The main message (how did you solve the problem?)\n3. The details supporting the main results\n\n\nWhen designing a graphic, presentation or document you should have a focus on conveying the message -- the \"so what?\" \n\n> Too often, when we communicate with data, we don't make our point clear. We leave our audience guessing. **Your audience should never have to guess what message you want them to know.** The onus is on the person communicating the information (you!) to make that clear.[^message]\n\n[^message]: [https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2017/3/22/so-what](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2017/3/22/so-what). This post is worth reading in full.\n\nState the upshot of your presentation explicitly and at the beginning. It is tempting to save the conclusions until after presenting the details of the analysis or to assume the audience will just understand the point without you explicitly stating it. While these strategies may be effective for writing a novel, they are not effective for technical communication.\n\n<!-- Mathematics is communicated this way. Mathematical results are typically presented *theorem-proof* style meaning they state the theorem first then prove the theorem (opposed to first prove the result then state the result that was just proved).  -->\n\nThe rule of *message before details* applies both at a macro-scale (e.g. executive summary) and at a micro-scale (e.g. plot titles). Some concrete recommendations include:\n\n- Include an executive summary/abstract at the beginning of the document.\n- State the upshot of the graphic in the title (e.g. see [this post](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2017/3/22/so-what)).\n- Similarly for a PowerPoint, state the upshot in the title of a slide.\n- Functions should have informative names (e.g. `str_extract` (good) vs `grep` (bad)).\n- When communicating a complex concept (e.g. a theorem) state the intuition before formally defining the concept.\n\n\n\nFocusing on the message first requires that you understand the message. \n\n> How can I know what I think till I see what I say?[^emforster]\n\n[^emforster]: E.M. Forster\n\nYou sometimes have to write for a while until you understand what the thesis is. \n\n\n\n### Hierarchical is better than sequential\n\n\n<!-- ![Hierarchical](images/hierarchical.png){fig-align=center width=\"400\"} -->\n\n\n<!-- ![Flat/sequential](images/flat.png){fig-align=center width=\"400\"} -->\n\nHumans tend to process hierarchical information better than sequential information. \n\n::: {layout-nrow=2 fig-align=\"center\" fig-width=500}\n![Flat/sequential organization](images/flat.png)\n\n![Hierarchical organization](images/Hierarchical.png)\n:::\n\n\n\nTextbooks are organized into: chapters, sections, subsections, paragraphs, sentences etc. Imagine if a textbook were just a straight wall of text! We categorize living creatures into a hierarchical taxonomy (kingdom, phylum, ...). Items in grocery stores are group together in aisles/sections and the aisles are roughly arranged to be similar (e.g. the fruit section is near the vegetable section). The [topics in stat20](https://www.stat20.org/schedule.html) are grouped together into units (e.g. questions, prediction, generalization). The [taxonomy of data](https://www.stat20.org/1-questions-and-data/02-taxonomy-of-data/notes.html#a-taxonomy-of-data) gives a hierarchical organization of data types.\n<!-- A complex function is composed of many helper functions.  -->\n\n\n\n\n<!-- For a more concrete example, compare: -->\n\n<!-- > *My research has both theoretical and applied components: dimensionality reduction for network valued random variables, temporally evolving preferential attachment models, support vector machine in high dimensional settings, DTI structural connectivity networks, text analysis of Supreme Court decisions.* -->\n<!-- to -->\n\n<!-- *My research has two components.* -->\n\n<!-- *Theory* -->\n\n<!-- - Dimensionality reduction for network valued random variables. -->\n<!-- - Temporally evolving preferential attachment models. -->\n<!-- - Support vector machine in high dimensional settings. -->\n\n<!-- *Application*  -->\n\n<!-- - DTI structural connectivity networks. -->\n<!-- - Text analysis of Supreme Court decisions. -->\n\n<!-- The depth of the hierarchy you use is dependent upon the medium. For a written document try not to use more than three levels (chapters, sections, and subsections). For an oral presentation two levels is better. -->\n\n\n### Make the structure easy to navigate and understand\n\n<!-- The audience should be able to navigate easily around a document. Furthermore, the audience should know where they are at all times.  -->\n\nIt's helpful for the audience to know where they are (e.g. what lecture notes are you reading?) and ideally be able to navigate easily around a document.\nOur notes have a floating table of contents at the top right. Textbooks provide a table of contents, number section headings, and provide page numbers at the bottom. Websites typically have a site map at the top. In oral presentations it can be helpful to show the outline at the beginning and periodically state where you are in the lecture.  \n\n\n<!-- ## Communicate at different levels -->\n\n<!-- A technical document often communicates to different types of audiences; the same document might be read by both executives, scientists and statisticians. The same reader might shift categories; the first time I read a paper I'm looking for the upshot/core ideas while the second time I read the paper I try to understand the technical details. Therefore, a document (paper, PowerPoint, etc) should communicate its message at multiple levels. -->\n\n<!-- Stating the message then the details is an example of communicating at different levels. Academic papers include details both in the body of the paper and the appendix.  -->\n\n\n### Communicate at multiple levels\n\nThe report you write about your data analysis might have different target audiences.\nIf you analyze the efficacy of a medical device, your report might target doctors, business executives, and statisticians. Different members of the target audience will be interested in different parts of your report. The executives might just want to know the binary  yes/no the device works; the doctors might want to know which patients the device was most effective for; the statisticians might want to know the details of the analysis you performed. \n\nTo satisfy all of these people simultaneously you have to write at multiple levels. For example, most scientific papers have a title, abstract, introduction, methods section, results section, and appendix. The executives might only want to read the title/abstract; the doctors might also want to read the results; the statisticians might be interested in details in the methods section and appendix.\n\n\n## Visualizations\n\nVisualizations are some of the most powerful tools for communicating in data science.\nFor a given analysis the best plot depends on the context. \nWe often make two versions of the same plot, a quick exploratory plot then a more careful communicatory plot.\nThese two types of plots serve different purposes.\n\nTo illustrate these two types of plots, let's use a dataset from Capital Bikeshare.[^capital]\nCapital Bikeshare is a bike sharing system for Washington DC that makes their hourly rental data publicly available.\n\n[^capital]: See [https://capitalbikeshare.com/how-it-works](https://capitalbikeshare.com/how-it-works). They make their data publicly available at [https://ride.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data](https://ride.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nbikes <- read_csv('https://www.dropbox.com/s/f7wj0oxxckhvrn8/bikes_2011.csv?dl=1')\nbikes %>% \n    select(hr, cnt, workingday)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 8,645 × 3\n      hr   cnt workingday\n   <dbl> <dbl>      <dbl>\n 1     0    16          0\n 2     1    40          0\n 3     2    32          0\n 4     3    13          0\n 5     4     1          0\n 6     5     1          0\n 7     6     2          0\n 8     7     3          0\n 9     8     8          0\n10     9    14          0\n# … with 8,635 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Exploratory plot: speed and details\n\nWhen we first analyze a data set we often rapidly make many exploratory plots. Exploratory plots emphasize details over message and quantity over quality.\n\nThe target audience for an exploratory plot is the person making it and possibly close collaborators. It is created quickly (e.g. 2 lines of code) and contains lots of information.\n\nLet's take a look at the rental counts per hour over the course of the year for Capital Bikeshare (note working day = Mon-Fri vs. Weekend/Holiday).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bikes) +\n    geom_point(aes(x=hr, y=cnt, color=factor(workingday)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](notes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis quick-and-dirty plot might be informative to an analyst familiar with this kind of data, but would be puzzling to the average viewer. Consider how much detail is present in this plot. Every observation in the data set is present in this plot - over 8,000 of them. With a careful eye, you can use the white grid lines to get a good sense of the precise x- and y-values of each observation. This is aided by the axes, which have many tick marks displaying the different values they can take.\n\nThis detail might be helpful to the seasoned analyst but could be confusing to the average viewer. Would they know what \"factor(workingday)\" means? Would they be able to come away with a single clear message of what the data show? Probably not. For that, we need a communicatory plot.\n\n### Communicatory plot: message and quality\n\nAfter concluding an analysis, the final presentation will likely have several figures in them whose purpose is to effectively communicate the findings to the intended audience. The main purpose of a communicatory plot is message, not details. \nOften creating a good communicatory visualization is about decluttering. Less is more! For example, watch [this blog post](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2017/3/29/declutter-this-graph) step through decluttering a poor visualization.\n\nThe plot below is designed to communicate the findings to a general audience (e.g. business executives). This plot took longer to make (30 lines of code) and focuses on the message.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# reduce to hourly data\nby_hour <- bikes %>% \n    mutate(workingday = ifelse(workingday == 1, 'yes', 'no')) %>% \n    group_by(workingday, hr) %>% \n    summarise(cnt = median(cnt))\n    \nmorning_peak <- filter(by_hour, hr == 8, workingday=='yes')$cnt\nafternoon_peak <- filter(by_hour, hr == 17, workingday=='yes')$cnt\n\nggplot(by_hour) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = hr, y = cnt, \n                color = workingday, linetype = workingday), linewidth = 1) +\n  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), # backgound/axis\n        axis.line = element_line(colour = \"black\", size = .1),\n        legend.key = element_rect(fill = \"white\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(6, 12, 18, 23), # axis\n                     limits=c(0,23),\n                     expand=c(0, 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0, 200, 400),\n                     limits=c(0, 450),\n                     expand=c(0,0)) +\n  labs(x = 'Hour of the day',\n       y = 'Rider Count (median)',\n       title = 'Rental patterns differ between working vs. non-working days') +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Working Day\"),\n         shape = guide_legend(title = \"Working Day\"),\n         linetype = guide_legend(title = \"Working Day\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 12, y = 430, label = 'rush hour')) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 10.3, y = 427, xend = 8.5, yend = morning_peak),\n               linewidth = .1,\n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.03, 'npc'))) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 13.5, y = 427, xend = 16.5, yend = afternoon_peak),\n               linewidth = .1, arrow = arrow(length=unit(0.03, 'npc')))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](notes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice the design decisions that were made to hone the message:\n\n- Title states the message of the plot.\n- Use median count per hour as a summary instead of showing every data point.\n- Axes are labeled in clear english.\n- No background grid and fewer axis ticks.\n    - The precise numbers are not important for the message.\n- Rush hour peaks are annotated for emphasis.\n- Working data is coded in two ways:\n    - Color\n    - Line type\n    \nYou can learn how to customize ggplot through some googling.[^ggplot]\n\n[^ggplot]: [These notes](https://idc9.github.io/stor390/notes/custom_viz/custom_viz.html) give some example code for customizing ggplot.\n\n## Programming\n\nWriting code is an act of communication with two audiences: the computer and other programmers.\nOther programmers include a future you. \n\n### Coding\n\nIt is important to write *readable* software meaning code that is straightforward for someone to understand.\nReadability in software is an engineering principle; the easier your code is to understand, the less likely there is to be a bug, the faster you will debug issues that do come up, and the easier it is to modify.\n\nThere are a few techniques you can use to make your code more readable.\n\n\n- Use **informative names** that tell you what a variable/function/file is. For example, `avg_loudness = mean(cat_meow_volumes)` is better than `a = mean(cmv)`.\n\n- Follow a **consistent and standard naming format** -- typically either `snake_case` or `CamelCase`.\n\n- Use **line breaks and indentation**. For example, compare the following two snippets that do the same thing:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nlibrary(stat20data)\ndata(ppk)\n    \nppk %>%  drop_na(Q10) %>% mutate(Q10 = factor(Q10, levels = c(\"Very important\", \"Somewhat important\", \"Neither important nor unimportant\", \"Somewhat unimportant\",  \"Very unimportant\"))) %>%  ggplot(aes(y = Q10)) + geom_bar()+ ylab(\"Importance rating\") +  ggtitle(\"Importance rating breakdown\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nppk %>% \n  drop_na(Q10) %>%\n  mutate(Q10 = factor(Q10, levels = c(\"Very important\",\n                                      \"Somewhat important\",\n                                      \"Neither important nor unimportant\",\n                                      \"Somewhat unimportant\", \n                                      \"Very unimportant\"))) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(y = Q10)) +\n  geom_bar()+\n  ylab(\"Importance rating\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Importance rating breakdown\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n- **Comment your code**. You can add comments to your code -- lines of code that are read by humans but not the computer -- with the `#` symbol.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n# Calculate the average support for the People's Park Project by year before taking the survey\n# notice we have introduced a new function-- rename!\nppk %>% \n  rename(year = Q1, support_before = Q18) %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  summarise(avg_support = mean(support_before, na.rm = T))\n```\n:::\n\n\n- More generally, follow a **consistent coding style**. The norms you use for naming your variables, where you add white space and indentation, how to structure your comments - those are all wrapped up in what's called the \"style\" of your code. Most large organizations and companies that write and share code, will insist that their coders write code in the same style. Many of them follow what's called the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for R code.\n\n\n### Project organization\n\nUse hierarchy to organize complex projects. For example, organize your work into folders and sub-folders. Take a look at the [stat20 github repository](https://github.com/stat20/course-materials). The units are collected at the top of the directory (e.g. 3-prediction/), within a unit the lectures are collected together (e.g. 15-classification/), which then contain the notes, slides, etc.\n\nFiles should be given descriptive names and ideally follow one of the standardized naming formats (e.g. `snake_case` or `CamelCase`).[^no_space]\n\n[^no_space]: It's best to avoid putting spaces in file name because spaces in file names can mess up code that works with file names.\n\n\n\n### Asking for help\n\n\n::: {layout=[10,20] layout-valign=\"bottom\"}\n![Bad question](images/bad_question.png){ style=\"border:1px solid black\"}\n\n![Good question](images/good_question.png){ style=\"border:1px solid black\"}\n:::\n\n\nWe all get stuck coding and need to ask a friend/colleague/tutor for help.\nThe way we ask for help matters.\nAsking questions in a more effective manner makes the question more likely to be answered, and answered faster.\nA good question is 1) **complete**, 2) **minimal**, and 3) **reproducible.**[^questions]\nIn other words, all of the relevant information needed to understand the issue is provided and all irrelevant information is stripped away.\nFor example, you should send a snippet of R code instead of an entire qmd document with the little bit of relevant code buried in the middle.\nIdeally you should some example code that your colleague can run to reproduce the issue you're having.\n\n\n[^questions]:  Here are three blog posts that go into more detail:\n[How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask), [How to write a reproducible example](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html), and [How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve). The [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package is very useful for writing good questions in R.\n\nOften the act of asking a good question will cause you to figure out the problem. By simply trying to explain what's going on can cause you to see the issue. This called *rubber duck debugging*[^duck] and can be an effective strategy to debug your code. Before bugging someone else with your error, first try picking up a rubber duck and explaining to problem to it.[^email] \n\n![](images/duck.png){fig-align=center width=\"150\"}\n\n<!-- Duck from https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/magazine/the-rubber-duck-knows-no-frontiers.html -->\n\n[^duck]: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)\n\n[^email]: I tend to draft an email asking my question to a busy colleague whose respect is important to me, which forces me to really think through the issue.\n\n## Summary\n\nThese notes discussed four principles of communication (audience, signal-to-noise, redundancy, and trade offs) and a number of strategies (revision, message, hierarchy, structure, and multiple levels) to communicate more effectively. We then looked at how these strategies apply to making visualizations and programming. The content in these notes are guidelines, not laws. These are good things to default to, but there can be good reason to break from these guidelines.
