Which of the following four claims does it support?\n\n1. The CPI rose 8.3% in April.\n2. The CPI will likely rise throughout the summer.\n3. The global consumer price index rose in April.\n4. The CPI rose 8.3% because of the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn truth, this plot could be consistent with all these claims. They are, in turn, a descriptive claim, a prediction, a generalization, and a causal claim. This newspaper headline falls squarely in the first category, a **descriptive claim**, which seeks only to describe the data set that is on hand.\n\nAlthough 8.3% seems like a simple enough number, is it actually *summarizing* a vast data set of thousands of prices. The process of describing a data set invariably involves summarizing it, either with **numerical summaries** like 8.3% or with **graphical summaries** like the line plot show above. \n\nIn this unit, we will learn to critique and construct descriptive claims made with data. Although they sound elementary, descriptive claims are the most common form of claim made using data. They have the power to move, if not mountains, at least markets.\n\n![Four types of claims made with data covered in this class.](images/claims-only.png){#fig-claims width=\"500px\"}\n\n[^cpi]: To learn more, check out the Wikipedia page on the [CPI in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index) and the exhaustive description of how the data is collected at the [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/overview.htm#:~:text=The%20CPI%20represents%20changes%20in,life%20insurance)\n\n[^nyt]: Smialek, Jeanna (2022, May 11).

We'll discuss each in turn, starting with categorical data.\n\nWhen Dr. Gorman collected data near Palmer Station, Antarctica, she recorded a total of eight variables on 344 penguins, presented here in a data frame.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 344 x 8\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_~1 body_~2 sex    year\n   <fct>   <fct>              <dbl>         <dbl>      <int>   <int> <fct> <int>\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7        181    3750 male   2007\n 2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4        186    3800 fema~  2007\n 3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18          195    3250 fema~  2007\n 4 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA           NA      NA <NA>   2007\n 5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3        193    3450 fema~  2007\n 6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6        190    3650 male   2007\n 7 Adelie  Torgersen           38.9          17.8        181    3625 fema~  2007\n 8 Adelie  Torgersen           39.2          19.6        195    4675 male   2007\n 9 Adelie  Torgersen           34.1          18.1        193    3475 <NA>   2007\n10 Adelie  Torgersen           42            20.2        190    4250 <NA>   2007\n# ... with 334 more rows, and abbreviated variable names 1: flipper_length_mm,\n#   2: body_mass_g\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe first two of these you'll recognize as *nominal categorical* variables. The `species` of each penguin can take one of three levels: Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo; and the `island` on which they were found can also take three levels: Biscoe, Dream, or Torgersen.\n\n### Contingency tables\n\nIf I asked you to look at this data frame and describe what these two variables show, that's a surprisingly difficult task! The raw data frame has simply too much information to process at a glance. To make it easier, we need to consolidate all of that information into a few numerical summaries. Since these variables don't take numbers as values, we can't take an average or a median. What we can do, though, is simply count up the number of penguins that appeared in every combination of levels and lay them out in a table like this:\n\n<!-- Remake very polished tables using gt -->\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{>{}l||r|r|r}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{ } & \\textbf{Biscoe} & \\textbf{Dream} & \\textbf{Torgersen}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Adelie} & 44 & 56 & 52\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Chinstrap} & 0 & 68 & 0\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Gentoo} & 124 & 0 & 0\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{>{}l||r|r|r}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{ } & \\textbf{Biscoe} & \\textbf{Dream} & \\textbf{Torgersen}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Adelie} & 44 & 56 & 52\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Chinstrap} & 0 & 68 & 0\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Gentoo} & 124 & 0 & 0\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\\\n\nAfter a few moments of looking at this table, a few features emerge:\n\n1. The Chinstrap penguins were only found on Dream island.\n2. Adelie penguins are the most common.\n3. The most prevalent penguin type in this data set was a Gentoo from Biscoe Island.\n\nThis method of displaying data is called a contingency table.\n\n**Contingency table**\n:    A table that shows the counts or frequencies of observations that occur in every combination of levels of two categorical variables. Used to display the relationship between variables.\n\nWe can also opt to present these counts in graphical form by constructing a **bar chart**. There are two common methods for laying out counts across two variables in a bar chart.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Stacked bar chart](notes_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-6-1.pdf)\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Dodged bar chart](notes_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-6-2.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar chart puts one of the variables along the x-axis (the species) and fills up the y-axis according to the counts in each level of the other variable (the island). The side-by-side bar chart is similar, but unstacks the \"Adelie\" bar to put the three islands besides one another.\n\nSo with two similar to charts to choose from, which one should you pick? The stacked bar chart succeeds in highlighting the total number of Adelie penguins: 152 (also the sum of the top row of the contingency table). The side-by-side version makes that total harder to see, but it is easier to see at a glance the relative sizes of which islands each of those Adelie penguins came from.\n\n![A schematic showing the link between a data frame, a contingency table of counts, and a stacked bar chart for a subset of 16 of the 344 penguins.](images/two-var.png){#fig-two-var fig-alt=\"Sketch showing the flow for two variables from raw data to contingency table to barchart.\" fig-align=center width=\"550px\"}\n\n\n### From Counts to Proportions\n\nWhen you count the number of observations in each level of a categorical variable, you're encoding the overall magnitude of each. But often what is more important is the *relative* magnitude of each. We can emphasize this by converting counts into proportions.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{>{}l||r|r|r}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{ } & \\textbf{Biscoe} & \\textbf{Dream} & \\textbf{Torgersen}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Adelie} & 44 & 56 & 52\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Chinstrap} & 0 & 68 & 0\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Gentoo} & 124 & 0 & 0\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{>{}l||r|r|r||>{}r}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{} & \\textbf{Biscoe} & \\textbf{Dream} & \\textbf{Torgersen} & \\textbf{}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Adelie} & 0.128 & 0.163 & 0.151 & \\textbf{0.442}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Chinstrap} & 0.000 & 0.198 & 0.000 & \\textbf{0.198}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Gentoo} & 0.360 & 0.000 & 0.000 & \\textbf{0.360}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{\\textbf{}} & \\textbf{0.488} & \\textbf{0.361} & \\textbf{0.151} & \\textbf{\\textbf{1.000}}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{>{}l||r|r|r||>{}r}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{} & \\textbf{Biscoe} & \\textbf{Dream} & \\textbf{Torgersen} & \\textbf{}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Adelie} & 0.128 & 0.163 & 0.151 & \\textbf{0.442}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Chinstrap} & 0.000 & 0.198 & 0.000 & \\textbf{0.198}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Gentoo} & 0.360 & 0.000 & 0.000 & \\textbf{0.360}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{\\textbf{}} & \\textbf{0.488} & \\textbf{0.361} & \\textbf{0.151} & \\textbf{\\textbf{1.000}}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nThe table on the right contains two different types of proportions that can be found in the middle and margins of the table, respectively.\n\n**Joint Proportion**\n:    The proportion of observations of multiple variables that appear in a combination of levels of those variables. E.g. 44 / 344 = .128, the proportion of all 344 penguins that were Adelie and from Biscoe.\n\n**Marginal Proportion**\n:    The proportion of observations in one variable that appear in a single level of that variable. E.g. (44 + 124) / 344 = .488, the proportion of all penguins that were from Biscoe.\n\nFrom these proportions we can derive a third type of proportion.\n\n**Conditional Proportion**\n:    The proportion of observations in one level of one variable that appear in a level of a second variable. E.g. .128 / .488 = .262, the proportion of penguins from Biscoe that were Adelie.\n\nThese distinctions are important because often a subtle change in language can result in a dramatically different number. Revisit the observations made about the original table of counts:\n\n1. The Chinstrap penguins were only found on Dream Island.\n2. Adelie penguins were the most common.\n3. The most prevalent penguin type in this data set was a Gentoo from Biscoe Island.\n\nThe first observation refers to a conditional proportion: of the 68 total Chinstrap penguins, 68 of them were on Dream (a proportion of 1). The second refers to a marginal proportion: .422 of the penguins were Adelie versus .198 Chinstrap and .360 Gentoo. The third is a joint proportion: .360, or 124 out of all 344 penguins were Gentoos living on Biscoe.\n\nWith these distinctions in hand, we can construct a useful variant of the bar chart: the normalized stacked bar chart.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](notes_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-9-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nInstead of plotting raw counts, a normalized bar chart plots proportions. But which proportions? \n\nIf you look back and forth between this bar chart and the table of proportions, you'll eventually decide that this bar chart is showing conditional proportions. The height of the blue bar in the lower left corner indicates the proportion of all Adelie penguins that were from Torgersen: 52 / 152 = .342. Since `species` is in the denominator of this proportion, we say that we've \"conditioned on\" species.\n\nWe can take the same data and get a very different story if instead we condition on `island`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](notes_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-10-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, the height of the blue bar in the lower left of the plot shows the proportion of penguins from Biscoe that were Gentoo: 124 / 168 = .738.\n\nOne last question before we move on: of these two charts, which one more clearly shows the species distribution on Dream Island? Dream shows up in both charts, but only one gives you a good answer to this question.\n\nThe answer to this question comes from the second chart. Here the species breakdown on Dream is clearly shown in the middle bar: a bit more than half are Gentoo, the rest are Adelie. Trying to pry this information out of the first chart is actually impossible! When we conditioned on species, we lost the relative numbers of Chinstraps and Adelies - where they found in equal numbers or were there 100 Chinstraps for every Adlie? That information can't be back-engineered from the first chart, and without it, we can't reconstruct the distribution as seen in the middle bar of the second chart.\n\nThe lesson from this is powerful: if you wish to make a claim rooted in a conditional proportion and are using a normalized bar chart, it is essentially to think carefully about *which* conditional proportion your chart is displaying.\n\n### Identifying an association\n\nIs there an association between species and which island they are found on? With a clearer sense of proportions under our belt, we can define this more precisely.\n\n**Association**\n:    There is an association between two categorical variables if the conditional proportions vary as you move from one one level of the conditioning variable to the next.\n\nThis is best illustrated by showing the previous plot of the real data right next to an example of what a penguins data set would look like that exhibits *no* association between `species` and `island`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](notes_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-11-1.pdf)\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](notes_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-11-2.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn plot on the right, as you gaze from left to right, looking across first Biscoe, then Dream, then Torgersen Islands, you see that the distribution of species is unchanged. There are always the most Gentoos, then Chintraps, then Adelies, regardless of the island. This indicates that there is no association between the variables in this data set.\n\nThis stands in stark contrast to the plot of the real data on the left. On Biscoe Island, Gentoo penguins dominate, with a smaller proportion of Adelies. Chinstraps are nowhere to be found. On Dream Island, its the Gentoos that are absent and we find roughly similar proportions of Chinstraps and Adelies. On Torgersen we observed only Adelies. This data set exhibits a strong association between `species` and `island`.\n\n<!-- - start with one variable -->\n<!-- - discuss the notion of a \"distribution -->\n<!-- - do \"conditioning\" using filtering -->\n\n\n<!-- ### One variable -->\n\n<!-- - one way table -->\n<!-- - counts -->\n<!-- - proportion -->\n\n<!-- - barchart -->\n<!-- - normalized barchart -->\n\n<!-- ![](images/one-var.jpg){fig-alt=\"Sketch showing the flow for one variable from raw data to contingency table to barchart.\" fig-align=center} -->\n \n## Summary\n\nA wise statistician once said, \"In statistics, most of what we do is add things up. Sometimes we divide. The challenging part is deciding *what* to add and divide.\" This captures the deceptive simplicity of summarizing categorical data. Numerical summaries involve counts of categories or proportions. Those proportions can be joint proportions, marginal proportions, or conditional proportions. Those counts and proportions are commonly displayed in contingency tables or in bar charts. Subtle choices of which proportion to present results in the telling of dramatically different stories.\n\n\n## Materials from class\n\n\n#### Slides\n\n- [Andrew](https://andrew.quarto.pub/summarizing-categorical-data)\n- [Silas](slides.qmd)\n- [Shobhana](slides.qmd)\n- [Jeremy](slides.qmd)\n",
