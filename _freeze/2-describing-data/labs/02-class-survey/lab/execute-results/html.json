This workflow can be revisited but currently doesn't work because listings aren't updated with these dates, only the renderd docs. -->\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n---\npublished-title: \"release date\"\n---\n\n[[Discuss]{.btn .btn-primary}](https://edstem.org/us/courses/31657) [[Slides]{.btn .btn-primary}](slides.qmd)\n\n\n\n## Part I: Understanding the Context of the Data\n\nPlease record your answers on the worksheet below and upload it to Gradescope as Lab 1.1.\n\n- [Part 1: Understanding the Context of the Data](lab-context.qmd)\n\n\n## Part II: Computing on the Data\n\nThe real data from your surveys is available in the `stat20data` package as `class_survey`.\n\nUsing this data, i. construct the plots that you proposed in Part I and ii. calculate for the first three a measure of a typical observation (mean, median, or mode, as appropriate). Use these summaries to answer the original question in a sentence or two, noting, where appropriate, the shape of the distribution and what a \"typical\" observation is.\n\n#### Question 8  \nDo students prefer to spend time at the beach or in the mountains?\n\n#### Question 9  \nHow much coding experience do students have?\n\n#### Question 10  \nWhat are students' perceptions of the chance that there is a new COVID variant that disrupts instruction in Fall 2022?\n\n#### Question 11  \nWhat is the relationship between students' optimism for cryptocurrency and their skepticism of the effect of technology on interpersonal relationships?\n\n\n. . .\n\nSix variables appear in the survey data frame that were derived from the original `Title` question: `Artist`, `Humanist`, `Natural_Scientist`, `Social_Scientist`, `Comp_Scientist` and `Entrepreneur`. The `Artist` variable is `TRUE` for those students who most identified as an artist and `FALSE` otherwise. The other five variables are defined similarly.\n\nFor the following three questions, please answer with a plot and a sentence or two written response given the structure in the plot.\n\n#### Question 12  \nIs there an association between students most identifying as an entrepreneur and their optimism for cryptocurrency?\n\n#### Question 13  \nIs there an association between students most identifying as a humanist and their optimism for cryptocurrency?\n\n#### Question 14  \nPropose your own question involving one or two variables and answer it using a plot with a written interpretation.\n\n#### Question 15  \nPropose your own question involving two or three variables and answer it using a plot with a written interpretation.\n",
