This workflow can be revisited but currently doesn't work because listings aren't updated with these dates, only the renderd docs. -->\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n---\npublished-title: \"release date\"\n---\n\n[[Discuss]{.btn .btn-primary}](https://edstem.org/us/courses/31657) [[Slides]{.btn .btn-primary}](slides.qmd)\n\n\n\n## Part I: Understanding the Context of the Data\n\nPlease record your answers on the worksheet below and upload it to Gradescope as Lab 1.1.\n\n- [Part 1: Understanding the Context of the Data](lab-context.qmd)\n\n\n## Part II: Computing on the Data\n\nThe easiest way to create your qmd will be to run the following line of code at the console in RStudio. It will download the questions found below into a new qmd and put it into an RStudio project to help keep your code organized.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nusethis::use_course(\"https://tinyurl.com/lab-2-class-survey\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd answer yes to both questions that appear in the console.\n\n* * *\n\nThe real data from your surveys is available in the `stat20data` package as `class_survey`.\n\nUsing this data, i. construct the plots that you proposed in Part I, and ii. calculate for the first three a measure of a typical observation (mean, median, or mode, as appropriate). Use these summaries to answer the original question in a sentence or two, noting, where appropriate, the shape of the distribution and what a \"typical\" observation is.\n\n#### Question 1  \nDo students prefer to spend time at the beach or in the mountains?\n\n#### Question 2  \nHow much coding experience do students have?\n\n#### Question 3  \nWhat are students' perceptions of the chance that there is a new COVID variant that disrupts instruction in Fall 2022?\n\n#### Question 4  \nWhat is the relationship between students' optimism for cryptocurrency and their skepticism of the effect of technology on interpersonal relationships?\n\n\n. . .\n\nSix variables appear in the survey data frame that were derived from the original `title` question: `artist`, `humanist`, `natural_scientist`, `social_scientist`, `comp_scientist` and `entrepreneur`. The `artist` variable is `TRUE` for those students who most identified as an artist and `FALSE` otherwise. The other five variables are defined similarly.\n\nFor the following three questions, please answer with a plot and a sentence or two written response given the structure in the plot.\n\n#### Question 5  \nIs there an association between students most identifying as an entrepreneur and their optimism for cryptocurrency?\n\n#### Question 6  \nIs there an association between students most identifying as a humanist and their optimism for cryptocurrency?\n\n#### Question 7  \nPropose your own question involving one or two variables and answer it using a plot with a written interpretation.\n\n#### Question 8  \nPropose your own question involving two or three variables and answer it using a plot with a written interpretation.\n",
