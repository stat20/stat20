Please record your answers on the worksheet below and upload it to Gradescope as Lab 1.1.\n\n- [Part 1: Understanding the Context of the Data](lab-context.qmd)\n\n\n## Part II: Computing on the Data\n\n#### Quarto Lab Format\n\nThe second part of each lab is your chance to dive into a real data set to answer the questions that you posed in Part 1. To ensure your analysis is reproducible, please record your answers to these questions (both the text and code) in a .qmd file. Render your work to an HTML file regularly as a check that your code is running. When you are pleased with the result, print that HTML to a pdf, then upload to Gradescope as Lab 1.2.\n\nThe easiest way to create your qmd will be to run the following line of code at the console in RStudio. It will download the questions found below into a new qmd and put it into an RStudio project to help keep your code organized.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nusethis::use_course(\"https://tinyurl.com/lab-1-arbuthnot\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd answer yes to both questions that appear in the console.\n\n#### Lab Questions\n\nThe first several questions pertain to the `arbuthnot` data frame found in `library(stat20data)`.\n\n1. What is the time frame covered by Arbuthnot's data?\n\n2. Which year saw the greatest number of children christened?\n\n3. What is the proportion of girls christened in 1700?\n\n4. What is the trend over time in the total number of children christened? Please answer with a plot and written interpretation.\n\n5. What is the trend over time in the proportion of girls christened? Please answer with a plot and written interpretation.\n\nThe remaining questions pertain to the `present` data frame found in `library(stat20data)`.\n\n6. What is the time frame covered by the present-day data?\n\n7. In terms of general magnitude (size), how do the counts in Arbuthnot's data compare to the counts in the present-day data?\n\n8. What is the trend over time in the proportion of births that are girls? Please answer with a plot and written interpretation.\n\n9. Based on these two data sets, what claim are you prepared to make regarding John Arbuthnot's original question? What reservations, if any, do you have about using this data to make the claim?\n\n",
