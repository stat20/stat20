**SPORT OF CHOICE**: _________________

You will find that each sport you can choose from has two data-sets associated with it: a `teams` dataset and a `players` dataset. You can find excerpts of each dataset in a file attached to Ed. You can use these excerpts to answer many of the following questions.

## Question 1
Write out two descriptive and two predictive questions that you could answer about your sport of choice using statistics.

\   
\   
\   
\   

## Question 2

What is the unit of observation for the `teams` data set? What about for the `players` data set?

\   
\   
\   

## Question 3

What is a question you could answer using the `teams` data set but not the `players` data set, and vice versa?

\   
\   
\   
\   
\   


## Question 4

What is a question that we would need more granular (measured on a finer/more specific part of the game) data than the `teams` and `players` data set provide to answer?

## Question 7
Some people believe analytics is ruining sports because teams are more cautious which makes the games less entertaining. Do you agree or disagree? Why?
