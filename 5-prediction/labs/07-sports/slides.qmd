Coined by Bill James in 1980, sabermetrics is

> “the search for objective knowledge about baseball.”


## History of Sabermetrics

- The Bill James Baseball Abstract, annual book beginning in 1977

```{r echo = F, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}

```

## More Generally, Sports Analytics

```{r echo = F, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sports_analytics.png")
```

## More Generally, Sports Analytics

* Specific metrics such as 
    * Baseball: On-base percentage is the percentage of times a player reaches base on either a hit, walk, or by being hit by a pitch.
    * Football: DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average), which compares a player's success on each play to the league average based on a number of variables including down, distance, location on field, current score gap, quarter, and strength of opponent.
    * Soccer: Ball possession as the percent of the time that each team has the ball.
