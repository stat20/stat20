# Concept Question

## Describing Shape

:::{.poll}
Which of these variables do you expect to be uniformly distributed?

1. bill length of Gentoo penguins
2. salaries of a random sample of people from California
3. house sale prices in San Francisco
4. birthdays of classmates (day of the month)

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Gentoo") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +

# Measures of Center

## Mean, median, mode: which is best?

. . .

> It depends on your desiderata: the nature of your data and what you seek to capture in your summary.

. . .

:::{.poll}
Get out a piece of paper. You'll be watching a 3 minute video that discusses characteristics of a typical human. Note which numerical summaries are used and what for.

## General Advice

. . .

1. *Means* are often a good default for symmetric data.

. . .

2. *Means* are sensitive to very large and small values, so can be deceptive on skewed data.
> Use a median

. . . 

3. *Modes* are often the only option for categorical data.

. . .

But there are other notions of typical...

# Measures of Spread

##

:::{.poll}
There are two new food delivery services that open in Berkeley: Oski Eats and Cal Cravings. A friend of yours that took Stat 20 collected data on each and noted that Oski Eats has a mean delivery time of 29 minutes and Cal Cravings a mean delivery time of 27 minutes. Which would would you rather order from?
:::

##

```{r}
#| fig-height: 7.5
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-align: center
#| message: false

set.seed(513)
oski <- rnorm(23, 0, 2)
oski <- oski + (29 - mean(oski))
cal <- rnorm(23, 0, 8)
cal <- cal +  (27 - mean(cal))
df <- tibble(service = rep(c("oski", "cal"), each = 23),
             time = c(oski, cal))
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = time)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white") + 
  facet_wrap(vars(service), nrow = 2) +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20)
p1
```

```{r}
#| fig-height: 7.5
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 12
p1 + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 27, color = "blue", lty = 1, lwd = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 29, color = "goldenrod", lty = 1, lwd = 2)
```

> Would you still prefer to order from Cal?


## Summarizing Distributions of Data

You can construct a **statistical graphic** to show the **shape**, which you can describe in terms of **modality** and **skew**... [you can calculate a **measure of center** to convey a sense of a typical observation...]{.fragment}[and you can calculate a **measure of spread** to capture how much variability there is in the data.]{.fragment}

## Statistics as Engineering

How can we express the variability in this data set using a single number?

$$ 6 \quad 7 \quad 7 \quad  7 \quad 8 \quad  8 \quad 9 \quad 9 \quad 10 \quad 11  \quad 11$$

::::columns

:::{.column width="45%"}

:::{.callout-warning appearance="simple" icon=false}

## Desiderata

- The statistic should be *low* when the numbers are the same or very similar to one another.
- The statistic should be *high* when the numbers are very different.
- The statistic should not grow or shrink with the sample size ( $n$ ).

#### Existing statistics to utilize:

- sample size ( $n$ ): 11
- sample mean ( $\bar{x}$ ): 8.45
- sample median: 8
- sample mode: 7

::::

##

$$ {\Large 6} \quad 7 \quad 7 \quad  7 \quad 8 \quad  8 \quad 9 \quad 9 \quad 10 \quad 11  \quad {\Large 11}$$

. . .

### The Range

$$\textrm{range:} \quad max - min$$

. . .

$$ 11 - 6 = 5$$

. . .

**Characteristics**

- Very sensitive to extreme values!


##

$$ 6 \quad 7 \quad {\Large 7 \quad  7} \quad 8 \quad  {\large 8} \quad 9 \quad {\Large 9 \quad 10} \quad 11  \quad 11$$

. . .

### The Inner Quartile Range (IQR)

The difference between the median of the larger half of the sorted data set, $Q_3$, and the median of the smaller half, $Q_1$.

$$\textrm{IQR:} \quad Q_3 - Q_1$$

. . .

$$ 9.5 - 7 = 2.5 $$

. . .

**Characteristics**

- Robust to outliers
- Used to set the width of the box in a boxplot

##

$$ 6 \quad 7 \quad 7 \quad  7 \quad 8 \quad  8 \quad 9 \quad 9 \quad 10 \quad 11  \quad 11$$

. . .

### Mean Absolute Deviation

Take the differences from each observation, $x_i$, to the sample mean, $\bar{x}$, take their absolute values, add them up, and divide by $n$ .

$$MAD: \quad \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n |x_i - \bar{x}| $$

. . .

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- c(6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11)
sum(abs(x - mean(x)))/11
```

$$ MAD = 1.4 $$

. . .

**Characteristics**

- Incorporates information from all observations
- Robust to extreme values


##

$$ 6 \quad 7 \quad 7 \quad  7 \quad 8 \quad  8 \quad 9 \quad 9 \quad 10 \quad 11  \quad 11$$

. . .

### Sample Variance

Take the differences from each observation, $x_i$, to the sample mean, $\bar{x}$, square them, add them up, and divide by $n - 1$ .

$$s^2: \quad \frac{1}{n - 1}\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 $$

. . .

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- c(6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11)
sum((x - mean(x))^2)/(11-1)
var(x)
```

$$ s^2 = 2.87 $$

. . .

:::: {.columns}

**Characteristics**

::: {.column width="33%"}
- Incorporates information from all observations
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
- Moderately sensitive to extreme values

##

$$ 6 \quad 7 \quad 7 \quad  7 \quad 8 \quad  8 \quad 9 \quad 9 \quad 10 \quad 11  \quad 11$$

. . .

### Sample Standard Deviation

Take the differences from each observation, $x_i$, to the sample mean, $\bar{x}$, square them, add them up, divide by $n - 1$, then take the square root.

$$s: \quad \sqrt{\frac{1}{n - 1}\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2} $$

. . .

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- c(6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11)
sqrt(sum((x - mean(x))^2)/(11-1))
sd(x)
```

$$ s = 1.70 $$
