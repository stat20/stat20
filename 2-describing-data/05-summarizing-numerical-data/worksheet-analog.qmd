1. In the space below, outline a procedure to take a data set like the following and return a single statistic that fulfills the desiderata:
   a. The statistic will increase in magnitude as variability increases
   b. The statistic will decrease in magnitude as the variability decreases
   c. The statistic is zero when there is no variability

You can express your procedure as a written recipe or using mathematical notation.

$$ 6 \quad 7 \quad 7 \quad  7 \quad 8 \quad  8 \quad 9 \quad 9 \quad 10 \quad 11  \quad 11$$

2. Imagine that the small data set above had been measured in meters. Provide reasoning for would happen to the measure of center - mean, median, mode - if it had instead been measured in centimeters. Repeat the exercise for three measures of spread: standard deviation, variance, and IQR. Which measures are resistant to multiplication by a scalar (100 in this case)?

3. Sketch your best sense of the distribution of the following variable(s). For each, please: 

  i. Use a form of statistical graphic that emphasizes the important elements of the distribution.
  ii. Label the axes and provide plausible values for the tick marks.
  iii. Describe in words the shape, center, and spread of the distribution.
  iv. State measures of center and spread would be most appropriate.

Make a note of any assumptions you're making in interpreting these variable names.
