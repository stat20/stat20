## Part II: Computing on the Data

The real data from your surveys is available in the `stat20data` package as `class_survey`.

Using this data, i. construct the plots that you proposed in Part I, and ii. calculate for the first three a measure of a typical observation (mean, median, or mode, as appropriate). Use these summaries to answer the original question in a sentence or two, noting, where appropriate, the shape of the distribution and what a "typical" observation is.

#### Question 8  
Do students prefer to spend time at the beach or in the mountains?

#### Question 9  
How much coding experience do students have?

#### Question 10  
What are students' perceptions of the chance that there is a new COVID variant that disrupts instruction in Fall 2022?

#### Question 11  
What is the relationship between students' optimism for cryptocurrency and their skepticism of the effect of technology on interpersonal relationships?


. . .

Six variables appear in the survey data frame that were derived from the original `title` question: `artist`, `humanist`, `natural_scientist`, `social_scientist`, `comp_scientist` and `entrepreneur`. The `artist` variable is `TRUE` for those students who most identified as an artist and `FALSE` otherwise. The other five variables are defined similarly.

For the following three questions, please answer with a plot and a sentence or two written response given the structure in the plot.

#### Question 12  
Is there an association between students most identifying as an entrepreneur and their optimism for cryptocurrency?

#### Question 13  
Is there an association between students most identifying as a humanist and their optimism for cryptocurrency?

#### Question 14  
Propose your own question involving one or two variables and answer it using a plot with a written interpretation.

#### Question 15  
Propose your own question involving two or three variables and answer it using a plot with a written interpretation.
