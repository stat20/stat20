# Summarizing Numerical Data

#### Concept Acquisition

1. Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphic provides a unifying framework to describe a wide range of statistical graphics.
2. A plot can be decomposed into a series of layers that include the data, the aesthetic mappings, the geometry, and more.
3. Aesthetic mappings link the variability in a data variable to the variablity in an aesthetic / visual cue.
4. The geometry describes the manner in which the obserbations will be represented on the plot.
5. Facets allow for multiple subplots for subsets of the data.
