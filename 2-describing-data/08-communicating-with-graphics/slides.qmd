## Question 1

:::{.poll}
Which elements have been applied to the following plot?
:::

\

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center

arbuthnot %>%
    mutate(p_girls = girls / (girls + boys)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = year,
               y = p_girls)) +
    geom_line(color = "steelblue") +
    labs(x = "Year",
         y = "Proportion girls") +
    ylim(0, 1) +
    theme_bw(base_size = 24) +
    annotate("segment", 
             x = 1629, xend = 1710,
             y = .5, yend = .5,
             color = "dark green", lty = 2)

# Part I: Understanding the Context and Structure of the Data

## Lab Part I

1. What is the unit of observation in the data frame on the handout?

2. Which variables are categorical? Which variables are numerical? Do any of the variable have ambiguous data types to you?

3. Is there any discernible pattern to the manner in which the rows are ordered?

4. What is your guess for the units/format used to record the departure time?

5. What filter would you use to extract the flights that left in the springtime?


:::{poll}
In groups, please discuss the questions above.
