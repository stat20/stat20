# Concept Questions

## Question 1

```{r}
#| eval: false
c("fruit", "fruit", "vegetable") == "fruit"
```

:::{.poll}
What will this line of code return?

Respond at `pollev.com`.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```


## Evaluating equivalence, cont.

In R, this evaluation happens element-wise when operating on vectors.

```{r}
#| eval: false

c("fruit", "fruit", "vegetable") == "fruit"
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
c("fruit", "fruit", "vegetable") == "fruit"
```

. . .

```{r fruit5, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
c("fruit", "fruit", "vegetable") != "fruit"
```

. . .

```{r ref.label = "fruit5", echo = FALSE}
```

. . .

```{r fruit6, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
c("fruit", "vegetable", "boba") %in% c("fruit", "vegetable")
```

. . .

```{r ref.label = "fruit6", echo = FALSE}
```

## Question 2

Which observations will be included in the following data frame?

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
class_survey |>
  filter(coding_exp_scale < 3,
        olympics %in% c("Ice skating", "Speed skating"),
        is_entrepreneur == TRUE)
```

:::{.poll}
Please respond at `pollev.com`.

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```

<!--
## Question 3: Opinion

10. What are students’ perceptions of the chance that there is a new COVID variant that disrupts instruction in Spring 2023?

:::{.poll}
Do you think students in their first semester would be *more* likely or *less* likely to think we would remain in remote learning for the entire semester?

Answer at `pollev.com`.
:::

:::notes
Q: what is the comparison group: all students or students who are not in their first semester?

## Question 3

:::{.poll}
Which data frame will have fewer rows?
:::

. . .

```{r echo = TRUE}
#| eval: false
# this one
filter(class_survey, year == "This is my first semester!")

# or this one
class_survey |>
  mutate(first_sem = (year == "This is my first semester!")) |>
  filter(first_sem)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```


# Concept Question 2 Redux - Building data pipelines

> How do we extract the average of these students' chance that class will be disrupted by a new COVID variant?

Let's look at three different ways to answer this question

## Nesting {auto-animate=true}


```{r}
#| eval: false
filter(class_survey, 
       coding_exp_scale < 3,
       olympics %in% c("Ice skating", "Speed skating"),
       is_entrepreneur == TRUE)
```


## Nesting {auto-animate=true}


```{r}
#| eval: false
select(filter(class_survey, 
       coding_exp_scale < 3,
       olympics %in% c("Ice skating", "Speed skating"),
       is_entrepreneur == TRUE),
       coding_exp_xcale,
       olympics,
       is_entrepreneur,
       covid)
```

## Nesting {auto-animate=true}


```{r}
#| eval: false
summarize(select(filter(class_survey, 
       coding_exp_scale < 3,
       olympics %in% c("Ice skating", "Speed skating"),
       is_entrepreneur == TRUE),
       coding_exp_scale,
       olympics,
       is_entrepreneur,
       covid),
       covid_avg = mean(covid))
```

## Nesting {auto-animate=true}

```{r}
summarize(select(filter(class_survey, 
       coding_exp_scale < 3,
       olympics %in% c("Ice skating", "Speed skating"),
       is_entrepreneur == TRUE),
       coding_exp_scale,
       olympics,
       is_entrepreneur,
       covid),
       covid_avg = mean(covid))
```

## Data Pipelines

. . .

Most claims about data start with a *raw* data set, undergo many subsetting, aggregating, and cleaning operations, then return a *data product*.

![](images/pipeline-1.png)

. . .

> Let's look at three equivalent ways to build a pipeline

-->

## Nesting

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
summarize(select(filter(class_survey, 
       coding_exp_scale < 3,
       olympics %in% c("Ice skating", "Speed skating"),
       is_entrepreneur == TRUE),
       coding_exp_scale,
       olympics,
       is_entrepreneur,
       covid),
       covid_avg = mean(covid))
```

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Cons**

- Must be read from inside out `r emo::ji("thumbs_down")` 
- Hard to keep track of arguments `r emo::ji("thumbs_down")` 
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Pros**

- All in one line of code `r emo::ji("thumbs_up")`
- Only refer to one data frame `r emo::ji("thumbs_up")`
:::

::::


## Step-by-step

. . .

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
df1 <- filter(class_survey, 
              coding_exp_scale < 3,
              olympics %in% c("Ice skating", "Speed skating"),
              is_entrepreneur == TRUE)
df2 <- select(df1, 
              coding_exp_scale,
              olympics,
              is_entrepreneur,
              covid)
summarize(df2,
          covid_avg = mean(covid))
```

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Cons**

- Have to repeat data frame names `r emo::ji("thumbs_down")` 
- Creates unnecessary objects `r emo::ji("thumbs_down")` 
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Pros**

- Stores intermediate objects `r emo::ji("thumbs_up")`
- Can be read top to bottom `r emo::ji("thumbs_up")`

## Using the pipe operator

. . .

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
class_survey |>
  filter(coding_exp_scale < 3,
         olympics %in% c("Ice skating", "Speed skating"),
         is_entrepreneur == TRUE) |>
  select(coding_exp_scale,
         olympics,
         is_entrepreneur,
         covid) |>
  summarize(covid_avg = mean(covid))
```

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Cons**

- `r emo::ji("shrug")` 
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Pros**

- Can be read like an english paragraph `r emo::ji("thumbs_up")`
- Only type the data once `r emo::ji("thumbs_up")`
- No leftovers objects `r emo::ji("thumbs_up")`

## Understanding your pipeline

. . .

It's good practice to understand the output of each line of code by *breaking the pipe*.

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| error: true
class_survey |>
  select(covid) |>
  filter(year == "It's my first year.")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
class_survey |>
  select(covid)
```
:::

::::


## Concept Question 2 Redux

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
class_survey |> # A #<<
  filter(coding_exp_scale < 3,
         olympics %in% c("Ice skating", 
                         "Speed skating"),
         is_entrepreneur == TRUE) |> # B #<<
  select(coding_exp_scale,
         olympics,
         is_entrepreneur,
         covid) |> # C #<<
  summarize(covid_avg = mean(covid)) # D #<<
```

:::{.poll}
What are the dimensions (rows x columns) of the data frames output at each stage of this pipe?
:::

. . . 

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```


## Concept Question 4

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
summarize(class_survey, mean(year == "I'm in my first year."))
```

:::{.poll}
What is will this line of code return?

## Boolean Algebra

Logical vectors have a dual representation as `TRUE` `FALSE` and `1`, `0`, so you can do math on logicals accordingly.

```{r echo = TRUE}
TRUE + TRUE
```

. . .

```{r}
TRUE * TRUE
```

. . .

> Taking the mean of a logical vector is equivalent to find the proportion of rows that are `TRUE` (i.e. the proportion of rows that meet the condition).
