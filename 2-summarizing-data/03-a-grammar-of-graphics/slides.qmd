## Announcements {.scrollable}

- Quiz 1 is **not** this upcoming Monday, but *next* Monday(2/12) in-class.  This Monday will be a workshop to complete Lab 2 and PS 4.

. . . 

-   Lab 2 (both parts) due Tuesday Feb 13 at 9am.

. . . 

-   Problem Set 4 due Tuesday Feb 13 at 9am. 

. . . 

-   Two problem sets without numbers relating to the *Understanding the World with Data* and *A Grammar of Graphics* will be posted to the resources tab on the home page of the course website. These are *not* for a grade and are for studying purposes. 

. . . 

-   Quiz 1 on Monday Feb 12, in class. 
    -   Individual portion [25 minutes]
    -   Group (max. 3) portion [15 minutes]
    -   Please consult the Quiz Megathread and Syllabus for content and logistical questions.
    
# Concept Question
    
## What code was used to make the following plot?

```{r}
penguins |>
  filter(species == "Gentoo") |>
  mutate(is_male = (sex == "male")) |>
  ggplot(mapping = 
           aes(x = body_mass_g,
               y = is_male)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (in grams)",
      y =  "Male Penguin?",
      title = "Male Gentoo penguins have larger body masses")
  
```

## Concept Activity

You will be watching a 2.5 minute video of a presentation by a scientist, Hans Rosling, who studied global public health. He presents data visualizations depicting the change in life expectancy and family size over several decades in the 20th century.

:::{.poll}
On a piece of note paper:

- Sketch out the data frame used to create the graphic and add the names of the variables.
- List the aesthetic attributes used to encode the data in the graphic.
- Identify the geometry used in the plot.

Please turn to your neighbors and...

:::{.poll}
Discuss what you came up with in terms of . . .

- the variables present in the data frame
- the aesthetic attributes used to encode that data in the plot
- the geometry
:::

```{r}
countdown::countdown(4, top = 0)
```


## What were the variables and aesthetic attributes?

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Visual Cues / Aesthetics

- Location along the x-axis
- Location along the y-axis
- Size of point
- Color of point
- Animation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Variables

- Fertility rate
- Life expectancy
- Population
- Region
- Year
:::

::::


## What did the data frame look like?


What was the unit of observation? What were the variables? What were their type?

. . . 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Unit of observation

- A country in a given year
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Variables

- Fertility rate (continuous)
- Life expectancy (continuous)
- Population (continuous)
- Region (nominal)
- Year (discrete)
:::

::::

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## don't use the gapminder package data. Remake to have the original vars: life expectancy and fertility rate
library(gapminder)
gapminder %>%
  slice(1, 10) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")
```


## What geometry is used to represent the observations?

. . .

- Points
