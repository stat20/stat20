## Part I: Understanding the Context of the Data

Please record your answers on the worksheet below and upload it to Gradescope.

- [Part 1: Understanding the Context of the Data](lab-context.qmd)

To answer this worksheet, consult the printout of the original survey found [here](glimpse-class-survey.qmd).

## Part II: Computing on the Data

The real data from your surveys is available in the `stat20data` package as `class_survey`. To complete the following questions, you will need to find the columns in the `class_survey` data frame associated with each variable mentioned.

#### Question 1

> How much coding experience do students have?

Use the "scale" version for this question.

##### part a

Construct an appropriate plot for this variable using `ggplot2`.

##### part b

Then calculate *one* appropriate measure of a spread and *one* appropriate measure of center for this variable.

##### part c

Use these summaries to answer the survey question in a sentence or two.

#### Question 2

For this question only, you may use the following, modified dataset, which can be obtained by running the following code in R. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: false
filtered_survey <- filter(class_survey,
                          new_COVID_variant >= 0,
                          new_COVID_variant < 1)
```

> What are students' perceptions of the chance that there is a new COVID variant that disrupts instruction in Fall 2022?

##### part a

Construct an appropriate plot for this variable using `ggplot2`.

##### part b

Then calculate *one* appropriate measure of a spread and *one* appropriate measure of center for this variable.

##### part c

Use these summaries to answer the survey question in a sentence or two.

#### Question 3

> Is there an association between students' favorite season and terrain preference (beach or mountains)?

##### part a

Construct the plot that you proposed in **Part I** using `ggplot2`. *Ensure that the seasons are plotted in the order: spring, summer, fall, winter*.

##### part b

Then, state a measure of a typical observation of the terrain preference variable for each season group (what terrain does a typical student whose favorite season is fall prefer, and so on).

##### part c

Use these summaries to answer the survey question in a sentence or two.


#### Question 4

> Is there an association between students most identifying as an entrepreneur and their optimism for cryptocurrency?


You may treat the `entrepreneur` variable categorically.

##### part a

Construct an appropriate plot including both of these variables using `ggplot2`.

##### part b

Then calculate *one* appropriate measure of a spread and *one* appropriate measure of center for the cryptocurrency variable, grouping by the levels of the `entrepreneur` variable.

##### part c

Use these summaries to answer the survey question in a sentence or two.

#### Question 5

Six variables appear in the survey data frame that were derived from the original `title` question: `artist`, `humanist`, `natural_scientist`, `social_scientist`, `comp_scientist` and `entrepreneur`. The `artist` variable is `TRUE` for those students who most identified as an artist and `FALSE` otherwise. The other five variables are defined similarly. You may treat these variables categorically.

##### part a

Propose your own question involving any two variables in the dataset--*one* of which comes from the `title` variable group mentioned above.

##### part b

Construct a plot which would aid in answering this question using `ggplot2`.


##### part c -->

Grouping by the levels of the `title` group variable,
calculate or state *one* appropriate measure of center for
your second variable.

##### part d

Use these summaries to answer your question in **part a** in a sentence or two.
