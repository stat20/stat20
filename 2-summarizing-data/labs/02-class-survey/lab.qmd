## Part I: Understanding the Context of the Data

Please record your answers on the worksheet below and upload it to Gradescope.

- [Part 1: Understanding the Context of the Data](lab-context.qmd)

To answer this worksheet, consult a glimpse of the original survey data found [here](glimpse-class-survey.qmd). This will show you what a few students responded for each question. You should also view the survey questions as they were asked to students [here](images/survey.pdf).


## Part II: Computing on the Data

The real data from your surveys is available in the `stat20data` package as `class_survey`. To complete the following questions, you will need to find the columns in the `class_survey` data frame associated with each variable mentioned.

#### Question 1

> How much coding experience do students have?

Use the "scale" version for this question.

##### part a

Construct an appropriate plot for this variable using `ggplot2`.

##### part b

Then calculate *one* appropriate measure of a spread and *one* appropriate measure of center for this variable.

##### part c

Use these summaries to answer the survey question in a sentence or two.

#### Question 2

> What are students' perceptions of the chance that there is a new COVID variant that disrupts instruction in Fall 2022?

##### part a

Construct an appropriate plot for this variable using `ggplot2`.

##### part b

Then calculate *one* appropriate measure of a spread and *one* appropriate measure of center for this variable.

##### part c

Use these summaries to answer the survey question in a sentence or two.

#### Question 3  

> Is there an association between students' favorite season and terrain preference (beach or mountains)?

##### part a

Construct the plot that you proposed in **Part I** using `ggplot2`. *Ensure that the seasons are plotted in the order: spring, summer, fall, winter*. 

##### part b

Then, state a measure of a typical observation for the terrain preference variable for each season. 

##### part c

Use these summaries to answer the survey question in a sentence or two.


#### Question 4 

> Is there an association between students most identifying as an entrepreneur and their optimism for cryptocurrency?


You may treat the `entrepreneur` variable categorically.

##### part a

Construct an appropriate plot including both of these variables using `ggplot2`.

##### part b

Then calculate *one* appropriate measure of a spread and *one* appropriate measure of center for the cryptocurrency variable, grouping by the levels of the `entrepreneur` variable. 

##### part c

Use these summaries to answer the survey question in a sentence or two.

#### Question 5

Six variables appear in the survey data frame that were derived from the original `title` question: `artist`, `humanist`, `natural_scientist`, `social_scientist`, `comp_scientist` and `entrepreneur`. The `artist` variable is `TRUE` for those students who most identified as an artist and `FALSE` otherwise. The other five variables are defined similarly. You may treat these variables categorically.

##### part a

Propose your own question involving any two variables in the dataset--at least one of which comes from the `title` variable group mentioned above.

##### part b

Construct a plot which would aid in answering this question using `ggplot2`. 


##### part c 

Grouping by the levels of the `title` group variable,
calculate or state *one* appropriate measure of center for 
your second variable.

##### part d

Use these summaries to answer your question in **part a** in a sentence or two.
