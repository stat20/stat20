## Part I: Understanding the Context of the Data

Please record your answers on the worksheet below and upload it to Gradescope as Lab 1.1.

- [Part 1: Understanding the Context of the Data](lab-context.qmd)

To answer this worksheet, consult the printout of the original survey found [here](handout-survey.pdf).


## Part II: Computing on the Data

The easiest way to create your qmd will be to run the following line of code at the console in RStudio. It will download the questions found below into a new qmd and put it into an RStudio project to help keep your code organized.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: false
usethis::use_course("https://tinyurl.com/lab-2-class-survey")
```

And answer yes to both questions that appear in the console.

The real data from your surveys is available in the `stat20data` package as `class_survey`.

Using this data, i. construct the plots that you proposed in Part I, and ii. calculate for the first three a measure of a typical observation (mean, median, or mode, as appropriate). Use these summaries to answer the original question in a sentence or two, noting, where appropriate, the shape of the distribution and what a "typical" observation is.

#### Question 1  
Do students prefer to spend time at the beach or in the mountains?

#### Question 2  
How much coding experience do students have?

#### Question 3  
What are students' perceptions of the chance that there is a new COVID variant that disrupts instruction in Fall 2022?

#### Question 4  
What is the relationship between students' optimism for cryptocurrency and their skepticism of the effect of technology on interpersonal relationships?


. . .

Six variables appear in the survey data frame that were derived from the original `title` question: `artist`, `humanist`, `natural_scientist`, `social_scientist`, `comp_scientist` and `entrepreneur`. The `artist` variable is `TRUE` for those students who most identified as an artist and `FALSE` otherwise. The other five variables are defined similarly.

For the following three questions, please answer with a plot and a sentence or two written response given the structure in the plot.

#### Question 5  
Is there an association between students most identifying as an entrepreneur and their optimism for cryptocurrency?

#### Question 6  
Is there an association between students most identifying as a humanist and their optimism for cryptocurrency?

#### Question 7  
Propose your own question involving one or two variables and answer it using a plot with a written interpretation.

#### Question 8  
Propose your own question involving two or three variables and answer it using a plot with a written interpretation.
