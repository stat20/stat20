## Questions 6-7

Open up RStudio and write down the code you used to complete each of the following questions in the space below.

### Question 6

Consider the vector `q6` which was made as follows:

```{r}
q6 <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,NA)
```

Write R code to calculate the mean of `q6` so that the result is 3.5 (this is the mean of the numbers 1 through 6).
