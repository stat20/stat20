title: "Practice: Pricing Houses"

Please run the following code cell to load in the data and do the preliminary data wrangling steps found in the notes.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
LA <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/nzhmtmmnz4ix4rd/LA.csv?dl=1") %>%
    mutate(log_price = log(price),
           log_sqft = log(sqft),
           garage_num = na_if(garage, "4+"),
           garage_num = as.numeric(garage_num),
           garage_cat = fct_collapse(garage,
                                     "none" = "0",
                                     "small" = "1",
                                     "large" = c("2", "3", "4+")))
```



### Question 1
#### Data Wrangling Review

Which cities contain the three outlier mega-mansions discovered in the notes?

### Question 2
#### Something about transformation or NAs

### Question 3
#### Making predictions

Last year the University of California purchase a new house to serve as the resident of the university President and to host university functions. The address of the house is 2821 Claremont Blvd in Berkeley. Use the LA data to build a model to predict the value of this house (it is fine if the model is the same as the one in the notes). Was it an under- or over-estimate? Why do you think this is?
