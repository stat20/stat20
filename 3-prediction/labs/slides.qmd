It's a good idea to read up a bit on the history and practice of sabermetrics before facilitating this lab. Some resources:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics
- Moneyball the book: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball
- Moneyball the movie: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)
- Data sets used by sabermetricians: https://sabr.org/sabermetrics/data
