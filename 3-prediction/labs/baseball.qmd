*"Baseball is ninety percent mental. The other half is physical."* - Yogi Berra

## Part I: Understanding the Context of the Data

1. Write out two descriptive and two predictive questions that we could answer about baseball (or other sports) using statistics.

   There are a number of [publicly available baseball datasets](https://sabr.org/sabermetrics/data). One main source of data that we will use in this lab is the Lahman database which contains a number of data sets with different units of observation. Below are the first few rows and some of the columns for two of these data sets: Teams and Batting.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(Teams %>% 
                    select(yearID, teamID, franchID, G, W, L, R, RA, name) %>%
                    arrange(desc(yearID))
                  ))
knitr::kable(head(Batting %>% 
                    select(playerID, yearID, teamID, G, AB, R, H, BB, SO) %>%
                    arrange(desc(yearID))
                  ))
```

2. What is the unit of observation for the Teams data set? What about for the Batting data set?

3. What is a question you could answer using the Teams data set but not the Batting data set, and vice versa?

4. What is a question that we would need more granular (measured on a finer/more specific part of the game) data than the Teams and Batting data set provide to answer?

5. Roughly since 1962 MLB teams have played 162 games in a season. What do you think the distribution of wins looks like? Sketch a plot and describe.

6. What do you think the relationship between wins and runs looks like? Sketch a plot and describe.

7. Some people believe analytics is ruining baseball because teams are more cautious which makes the games less entertaining. Do you agree or disagree? Why?

## Part II: Computing on the Data

Use the following code to load in the Teams dataset from the Lahman database.

```{r, echo = T}
library(Lahman)
data(Teams)
```

8. Subset the Teams dataset to only include years from 2000 to present day. What are the dimensions of this filtered dataset?

9. Plot the distribution of wins. Describe the relationship.

10. Plot the relationship between runs and wins. Describe the relationship (form, direction, strength of association, presence of outliers).

11. Plot the relationship between runs allowed and wins. Describe the relationship. How does it compare to the relationship between runs and wins?

12. Fit a simple linear model to predict wins by runs. Write out the equation for the linear model report the $R^2$.

13. What is the average number of season runs and wins? Based on the previous model, how many games would you predict a team that scored the average number of runs would win? What about a team that scored 600 runs? What about 850 runs?

14. Fit a multiple linear regression model to predict wins by runs and runs allowed. Write out the equation for the linear model and report the $R^2$. How does this model compare to the simple linear regression from the previous question?

15. Fit a multiple regression model to predict wins using at least two other variables in this data set. How does the $R^2$ value change? Do you think the new model you created predicts wins better?
