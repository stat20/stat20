#### Concept Acquisition

1. The Data Science lifecycle represents the iterative process by which models questions, claims, data, and understanding inform one other.
1. The formulation of an empirical question informs the data that bears upon it.
1. The properties of the data determine the claims that it can support.
1. Common claims made with data include summaries, predictions, generalizations, and causal claims.

#### Tool Acquisition

1. Practice using the polling platform
1. Practice using the discussion platform

#### Concept Application
1. Identify data sets that will help answer a particular empirical question.
1. Classify a claim as a summary, prediction, generalization, or causal claim.
1. Formulate a claim that is supported by a particular data set.

:::{.def}
**Summary**
 ~ A description of some aspect of the data we have. 
:::

Example: Using data from a class survey, the average height of students in Stat 20 is 5'6. 

:::{.def}
**Generalization**
 ~Claiming that some aspect of a particular dataset we on hand will be hold true for a broader set of possible observations.
:::

<!-- Also: the use of a particular data set to draw a conclusion about the nature of the mechanism that generated the data. -->

Example: Based on our Stat20 survey data, we believe the average height of Cal students is 5'6. 

:::{.def}
**Causal Claim**
 ~ A claim that changing the value of one variable will influence the value of another variable.
:::

Example: Data from a randomized controlled experiment shows that taking a new antibiotic eliminates more than 99% of bacterial infections.

:::{.def}
**Prediction**
 ~ A guess about the value of an unknown variable, based on other known variables.
:::

Example: Based on reading the news and the price of Uber's stock today, I predict that Uber's stock price will go up 1.2% tomorrow.
