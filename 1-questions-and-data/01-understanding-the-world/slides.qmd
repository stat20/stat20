# Introductions

-   Let us first introduce ourselves!

   
# {{< fa pen-to-square >}} Introductions {background-color="#00403d"}

- In groups of 3, take turns introducing yourselves to one another by providing the info listed on the handout (your name, hometown, etc).

- Each person should finish with a handout filled-in with info on their groupmates. *Make sure you save this for later this week!*

:::{.notes}
These three photos were taken in quick succession by a physician and amateur photographer who was vising the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. He was watching the shoebill as it was walking down a path in the reeds. As the shoebill was ambling along, it encountered a duck in the middle of the path. It leaned down, picked up the duck in its beak, turned to the side, dropped the duck in the reeds, then proceeded to amble down the path.

## Takeaways from this exercise

We can call the process of:

-   having a question, 

. . . 

-   finding data to investigate that question,

. . .

-   reaching a conclusion, 

. . . 

-   and then thinking of a next step which starts everything over again

. . . 


-   the *data science lifecycle*.
  

This lifecycle involves **constructing and critiquing claims made using data**: which is the main goal of our course!

# Types of Claims

:::
:::

. . .

\
\

*Example*\
Using data from the Stat 20 class survey, the proportion of respondents to the survey who reported having no experience writing computer code is 70%.

\

<!-- Also: the use of a particular data set to draw a conclusion about the nature of the mechanism that generated the data. -->

*Example*\
Using data from the Stat 20 class survey, the proportion of Berkeley students who have no experience writing computer code is 70%.

:::{.column width="65%"}
\

> A claim that changing the value of one variable will influence the value of another variable.

:::
:::

. . .

\
\

*Example*\
Data from a randomized controlled experiment shows that taking a new antibiotic eliminates more than 99% of bacterial infections.

##

:::
:::{.column width="65%"}
\

> A guess about the value of an unknown variable, based on other known variables.

:::

. . .

\
\

*Example*\
Based on reading the news and the price of Uber's stock today, I predict that Uber's stock price will go up 1.2% tomorrow.

# Practice Concept Questions

## Practice Concept Questions

We will now re-examine a few pathways in the *data science lifecycle*:

-   Forming a question -> collecting data

. . . 

-   Collecting data -> making a claim


## From Questions to Data

. . .

> Is the incidence of COVID on campus going up or down?

. . .

:::poll
Discuss:

A. What type of *data* can help answer this question? Consider

   - Which different people / institutions collect relevant data
   - Is certain data not available? Why not?

B. Will this question be answered by a summary, a prediction, a generalization, or a causal claim?

## From Data to Claims

One source of data:

\

![](images/ucb-dashboard.png){fig-align=center}

. . .

> "The following dashboard provides information on COVID-19 testing performed at University Health Services or through the PCR Home Test Vending Machines on campus. It does not capture self-reported positive tests. It provides a look at new cases and trends, at a glance."


## {data-menu-title="Positivity Rates"}

![](images/ucb-covid.png){width=1000 fig-align=center}

:::{.poll}
Formulate one claim that is supported by this data[^1].
:::

{{< countdown "3:00" >}}

[^1]: The positivity rate is the number of positive tests over the total number of tests.

[[Load Lab Templates into RStudio](https://stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fberkeley-stat20%2FStat20-Labs-Fall24&urlpath=rstudio%2F&branch=master)]{style="font-size: 1.3em"}


# Lab 1

{{< countdown "15:00" >}}

## General Lab Workflow

1. Lab Questions will be posted to the course website.
2. You'll author your Lab Reports as Quarto Documents that blend text and code. They should contain only answers.
3. Render your .qmd file to a .pdf file then download that file from RStudio to your computer.
4. Go to Gradescope and upload your .pdf lab report, being sure to assign questions to the pages.


# Looking forward

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%" .incremental}
- Read the lecture notes for *Taxonomy of Data* (released Friday evening).
- If you have any questions, please leave a comment/question on the *Taxonomy of Data* thread on Ed.
- Answer the Reading Questions for *Taxonomy of Data* on Gradescope by 11:59 pm Mon/Tues (the night before your class).
- Lab 1 due Tuesday at 10 am on Gradescope.
- Worksheet Packet 1 (just 2 google surveys) due Tuesday at 10 am on Gradescope.
