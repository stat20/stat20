## Agenda

-   Introductions
-   The Data Science Lifecycle
-   Types of Claims with Practice
-   Course Structure and Syllabus
-   Intro to R and RStudio
-   Looking forward

# Introductions

-   Let us first introduce ourselves!
   
   
# {{< fa pen-to-square >}} Introductions {background-color="#00403d"}

- In groups of 3, take turns introducing yourselves to one another by providing the info listed on the handout (your name, hometown, etc).

- Each person should finish with a handout filled-in with info on their groupmates. *Make sure you save this for later this week!*

:::{.notes}
These three photos were taken in quick succession by a physician and amateur photographer who was vising the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. He was watching the shoebill as it was walking down a path in the reeds. As the shoebill was ambling along, it encountered a duck in the middle of the path. It leaned down, picked up the duck in its beak, turned to the side, dropped the duck in the reeds, then proceeded to amble down the path.

## Takeaways from this exercise

We can call the process of:

-   having a question, 

. . . 

-   finding data to investigate that question,

. . .

-   reaching a conclusion, 

. . . 

-   and then thinking of a next step which starts everything over again

. . . 


-   the *data science lifecycle*.
  

This lifecycle involves **constructing and critiquing claims made using data**: which is the main goal of our course!

:::
:::

. . .

\
\

*Example*\
Using data from the Stat 20 class survey, the proportion of respondents to the survey who reported having no experience writing computer code is 70%.

<!-- Also: the use of a particular data set to draw a conclusion about the nature of the mechanism that generated the data. -->

*Example*\
Using data from the Stat 20 class survey, the proportion of Berkeley students who have no experience writing computer code is 70%.

> A claim that changing the value of one variable will influence the value of another variable.

:::
:::

. . .

\
\

*Example*\
Data from a randomized controlled experiment shows that taking a new antibiotic eliminates more than 99% of bacterial infections.

##

:::{.column width="65%"}
\

> A guess about the value of an unknown variable, based on other known variables.

:::
:::

. . .

\
\

*Example*\
Based on reading the news and the price of Uber's stock today, I predict that Uber's stock price will go up 1.2% tomorrow.

# Practice Concept Questions

## Practice Concept Questions

We will now re-examine a few pathways in the *data science lifecycle*:

-   Forming a question -> collecting data

. . . 

-   Collecting data -> making a claim

. . . 

:::poll
Now, visit the PollEverywhere site provided by your instructor to answer the following questions.
:::


## From Questions to Data

. . .

> Is the incidence of COVID on campus going up or down?

. . .

:::poll
Will this question be answered by a summary, a prediction, a generalization, or a causal claim?
:::

. . . 

\

Also discuss: what type of *data* can help answer this question? Consider:

- Which different people / institutions collect relevant data
- Is certain data not available? Why not?

```{r}
countdown::countdown(6, top = 0)
```


## From Data to Claims

One source of data:

\

![](images/ucb-dashboard.png){fig-align=center}

. . .

> "The following dashboard provides information on COVID-19 testing performed at University Health Services or through the PCR Home Test Vending Machines on campus. It does not capture self-reported positive tests. It provides a look at new cases and trends, at a glance."


## {data-menu-title="Positivity Rates"}

![](images/ucb-covid.png){width=1000 fig-align=center}

:::{.poll}
Formulate one claim that is supported by this data[^1].
:::

```{r}
countdown::countdown(3, top = 0)
```

[^1]: The positivity rate is the number of positive tests over the total number of tests.

# Intro to R and RStudio

Visit [stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu](https://stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu)! We will now:

. . . 

-   Demo the four parts of RStudio
-   Show you how to work with a Quarto Document
-   Walk through the first few questions of Lab 0

## Components of RStudio

1. Console

2. Environment

3. Editor

4. File Directory

> Now we are going to switch over to RStudio to understand these 4 components a bit better.

## Components of RStudio

1. **Console**: Where the live R session lives. Type commands into the prompt `>` and press enter/return to run them. The Console is in the lower-left pane.

2. **Environment**: The space that keeps track of all of the data and objects that you have created or loaded and have access to. Found in the upper right pane.

3. **Editor**: Used to compose and edit text (.qmd files) and R code (.r files). Found in the upper left pane.

4. **File Directory**: Used to navigate between your files/folders on your Rstudio account. Can move, copy, rename, delete, etc. Found in the lower right pane.


## R as a calculator

R allows all of the standard arithmetic operations.

**Multiplication**
```{r}
#| echo: true
1 * 2 
```

**Division**
```{r}
#| echo: true
1 / 2
```

## Looking forward

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .incremental}
- Read the lecture notes for *Taxonomy of Data*. 
- If you have any questions, you may leave a comment/question on the *Taxonomy of Data* thread on Ed.
- Answer the Reading Questions for *Taxonomy of Data* on Gradescope by 11:59 pm on Wednesday. 
- Problem Sets 1 (today) and 2 (Thursday/Friday) will be due **next Tuesday** at 9am!
