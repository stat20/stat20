This first lab has only one question:

> Where are you from *or* where would you like to visit?

Please submit a one page pdf that answers that question. Your answer should contain three components:

- The county and state that you are from. If you are from abroad, provide the name of a county and state that you would like to visit. This should show up as a heading (larger, heavier font).
- 1-3 paragraphs about this county in text, as described by Wikipedia.
- An enumerated list of your top three favorite things about this county.
