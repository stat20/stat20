## Agenda

-   Concept Questions: Taxonomy of Data
-   Reading Questions
-   Practice Problems
-   *Break*
-   Lab 1: Getting Started

# Concept Questions

## 

*Variable*: A characteristic that varies from individual to individual.

Examples:

-    Height

-   Weight

-   Glucose level

-   Eye color

-   Handedness

-   Zip code
\
\

## 

::: poll
What type of variable is *age*?
:::

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```

##  {data-menu-title="Shoebill Pic 1" background-image="images/shoebill-1.png" background-size="contain"}

## Images as data

::: columns
::: {.column .incremental width="55%"}
-   Images are composed of pixels (this image is 1012 by 1520)

-   The color in each pixel is in RGB

    ![](images/rgb.png){width="460"}

-   Each band takes a value from 0-255

-   This image is data with 1020 x 1520 x 3 values.
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
![](images/shoebill-1.png){fig-alt="A shoebill with a duck in its mouth." width="800"}
:::
:::

## Grayscale

::: columns
::: {.column .incremental width="55%"}
-   Grayscale images have only one band
-   0 is black, 255 is white
-   This image is data with 1020 x 1520 x 1 values.

::: fragment
> To simplify, assume our photos are 8 x 8 grayscale images.
:::
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
![](images/shoebill-1-grayscale.png){fig-alt="A shoebill with a duck in its mouth in grayscale." width="800"}
:::

## Images in a Data Frame

::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/shoebill-1.png)
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/shoebill-2.png)
:::

::: {.column width="34%"}
![](images/shoebill-3.png)
:::
:::

::: poll
If you were to put the data from these (8 x 8 grayscale) images into a data frame, what would the dimensions of that data frame be in rows x columns?
:::


```{r}
countdown::countdown(4, top = 0)
```

::: notes
8x8 gray scale  dimensions
3 rows for each image, 64 columns with numbers from 0-255. 

But walk through some of the student answers
and ask students to explain
