# Concept Questions


## Types of Variables

There are three things a variable could be referring to

:::incremental
1. a *phenomenon*
2. how the phenomenon is being *recorded or measured* into data
   - what values can it take? (this is often an intent- or value-laden exercise!)
   - for numerical units, what unit should we express it in?
3. How the recorded data is being *analyzed*
   - binning/discretizing income data
   - if a barchart has too many bars, using a histogram.

## {data-menu-title="Shoebill Pic 1" background-image="images/shoebill-1.png" background-size="contain"}

## Images as data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%" .incremental}
- Images are composed of pixels (this image is 1520 by 1012)
- The color in each pixel is in RGB
  
  ![](images/rgb.png){width="460"}

- Each band takes a value from 0-255
- This image is data with 1520 x 1012 x 3 values.
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
![](images/shoebill-1.png){fig-alt="A shoebill with a duck in its mouth." width="800"}
:::

::::


## Grayscale

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%" .incremental}
- Grayscale images have only one band
- 0 is black, 255 is white
- This image is data with 1520 x 1012 x 1 values.

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
![](images/shoebill-1-grayscale.png){fig-alt="A shoebill with a duck in its mouth in grayscale." width="800"}
:::

::::

## Grayscale

:::: {.columns}

-  To simplify, assume our photos are 8 x 8 grayscale images.


::: {.column width="45%"}
![](images/shoebill-1-gray8.png){fig-alt="An 8 x 8 grayscale image" width="500"}
:::

::::

## Images in a Data Frame

Consider the following images which are our data:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/shoebill-1.png)
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/shoebill-2.png)
:::

::: {.column width="34%"}
![](images/shoebill-3.png)
:::


:::{.incremental}

- Let's simplify them to 8 x 8 grayscale images

## Images in a Data Frame



:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/shoebill-1-gray8.png)
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/shoebill-2-gray8.png)
:::

::: {.column width="34%"}
![](images/shoebill-3-gray8.png)
:::

::::


:::{.poll}
If you were to put the data from these (8 x 8 grayscale) images into a *data frame*, what would the dimensions of that data frame be in rows x columns?

:::{.bigadage}
Goal: write a brief memo about your home county.

## Step-by-step

1. Create and save a new .qmd file.
1. Add a title and author.
1. Add a header with the name of the county and state (if you are from abroad, provide the name of a county and state that you would like to visit)
1. Add 1-3 paragraphs about this county in text, as described by Wikipedia.
1. An example of **bold** and *italics* text.
1. A bulleted list of your top three favorite things about this county.
1. A sentence at the bottom with an acknowledgement that text came from Wikipedia along with a link to that source.
