# Concept Questions: Conceptual

## Quick Refresher




## {data-menu-title="Shoebill Pic 1" background-image="images/shoebill-1.png" background-size="contain"}


## Images as data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%" .incremental}
- Images are composed of pixels (this image is 1520 by 1012)
- The color in each pixel is in RGB
  
  ![](images/rgb.png){width="460"}

- Each band takes a value from 0-255
- This image is data with 1520 x 1012 x 3 values.
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
![](images/shoebill-1.png){fig-alt="A shoebill with a duck in its mouth." width="800"}
:::

::::


## Grayscale

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%" .incremental}
- Grayscale images have only one band
- 0 is black, 255 is white
- This image is data with 1520 x 1012 x 1 values.

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
![](images/shoebill-1-grayscale.png){fig-alt="A shoebill with a duck in its mouth in grayscale." width="800"}
:::

::::

## Grayscale

:::: {.columns}

-  To simplify, assume our photos are 8 x 8 grayscale images.


::: {.column width="45%"}
![](images/shoebill-1-gray8.png){fig-alt="An 8 x 8 grayscale image" width="500"}

## Images in a Data Frame

Consider the following images which are our data:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/shoebill-1.png)
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/shoebill-2.png)
:::

::: {.column width="34%"}
![](images/shoebill-3.png)
:::


:::{.incremental}

- Let's simplify them to 8 x 8 grayscale images

## Images in a Data Frame



:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/shoebill-1-gray8.png)
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/shoebill-2-gray8.png)
:::

::: {.column width="34%"}
![](images/shoebill-3-gray8.png)

:::{.poll}
If you were to put the data from these (8 x 8 grayscale) images into a *data frame*, what would the dimensions of that data frame be in rows x columns? Answer at `pollev.com`.
:::

## A note on variables

There are three things that "variable" could be referring to:

:::incremental
1. a *phenomenon*
2. how the phenomenon is being *recorded or measured* into data
   - what values can it take? (this is often an intent- or value-laden exercise!)
   - for numerical units, what unit should we express it in?
3. How the recorded data is being *analyzed*
   - might you bin/discretizing income data? what are the consequences of this?
:::

## What type of variable is age?

For each of the following scenarios where age could be a variable, choose the most appropriate taxonomy according to the Taxonomy of Data.

. . . 

1. Ages of television audiences/demographics
2. Ages of UC Berkeley students
3. The age of a radioactive particle

## Educated Guess 1

:::{.poll}
What will happen here?

\

Answer at `pollev.com/<name>`
:::

\

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}
1 + "one"
```

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```

:::{.notes}
- "one" is a string with no link at all to the number 1
- without that link, without two objects that are recognized for their numerical value, `+` doesn't work.
:::

## Educated Guess 2

:::{.poll}
What will happen here?

\

Answer at `pollev.com/<name>`
:::

\

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
sqrt(log(a))
```

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```

:::{.notes}
Talking points
- a is a vector of length four
- log and sqrt are functions that will return vectors of length four
- they're nested and will be evaluated from the inside out
:::


## Educated Guess 3

:::{.poll}
What will happen here?

\

Answer at `pollev.com/<name>`
:::

\

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

a <- 1 + 2
a + 1
```

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```

:::{.notes}
- a is a not a string, it's the name of an object that's a number
- to overwrite a with `a + 1` requires re-assigning it to a: `a <- a + 1` (in some languages, `a + 1` would change the value of a)
- `a <- a + 1` is a good time to mention that while `a = a + 1` works in R and they might see it online, its convention to use <- for many reasons including that mathematically the statement with = is confusing.
:::

## Educated Guess 4

:::{.poll}
What will happen here?

\

Answer at `pollev.com/<name>`
:::

\

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| error: true

a <- c(1, 3.14, "seven")
class(a)
```

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```

:::{.notes}
- the definition of a vector requires every element to be of the same type
- based on their reading, there are three classes that they're familiar with: numeric, factor, and character
- there's no way to translate "seven" into 7, so instead 1 and 3.14 must be translated into strings
- they will likely encounter this when looking at a data set in R (or other languages) and finding that vectors with what looked like numbers are stored as strings. This usually happens because there's a single errant character that the language doesn't know how to parse as a number.

:::{.bigadage}
Goal: write a brief memo about your home county.
:::

## Step-by-step

1. Create and save a new .qmd file.
1. Add a title and author.
1. Add a header with the name of the county and state (if you are from abroad, provide the name of a county and state that you would like to visit)
1. Add 1-3 paragraphs about this county in text, as described by Wikipedia.
1. An example of **bold** and *italics* text.
1. A bulleted list of your top three favorite things about this county.
1. A sentence at the bottom with an acknowledgement that text came from Wikipedia along with a link to that source.
