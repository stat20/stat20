## Modifying your own slides

1. Be sure your personal fork of the `course-materials` is up to date by syncing it to the one on `github.com/stat20`.

2. Pull the most recent changes from your fork to your local machine.

3. Make changes to `slides.qmd` and save.

## Publishing your own slides

Quarto Pub is a free service for publishing quarto documents, including slides, online. Start by setting up an account at <https://quartopub.com/>.

1. Once you are set up with an account, in the terminal, navigate to the directory that contains your slides, for example: `cd summarizing-numerical-data`.

2. Open `slides.qmd` and, ensure that under `revealjs:` that you add the option `self-contained: true`. (read more [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#self-contained))

3.   In that directory run:

   ```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
   quarto publish quarto-pub slides.qmd
   ```
   
4. You may be prompted to answer a few questions at the terminal. If it successfully published, it will provide a link to your published document

5. At this point, you're all set!

If you'd like to learn more about publishing with Quarto Pub, see the [official documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html).

## Test it out!

Test it out by working in a much simpler directory than `course-materials`, one called `practice-repo`. Since you won't be pushing any commits back up to GitHub, you don't need a create your own fork.

1. Create a new project in Rstudio from a version control repository and paste in `https://github.com/stat20/practice-repo` for the url.

2. Modify `slides.qmd` in the `summarizing-numerical-data` directory by, say, replacing `"Instructor"` with your name in the header.

3. In the terminal, navigate into the sub-directory with the slides: `cd summarizing-numerical-data`

4. Still at the terminal, publish your slides:

   ```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
   quarto publish quarto-pub slides.qmd
   ```
   
   Click through any prompts you might see at the terminal.

5. If it publishes successfully, the terminal will print a link to your published document. Visit that site and check the link at the top that it says that it has been "Published at ...". It should appear as `<user_name>.quarto.pub/summarizing-categorical-data/`.
