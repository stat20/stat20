## Reader Meeting

Readers meet with the head reader once each week for 1 hour. Those meeting generally involve.

1. Check-ins on the previous week's grading
2. Group sprints to finish up almost-done assignments
3. Introduction to new labs: the context, major questions, type of R code in use.
4. 20-30 min segments where you grade through assignments longitudinally to test out the rubric and discuss.
